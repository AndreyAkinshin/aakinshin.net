I have just published a preprint of a paper 'Weighted quantile estimators'.
It's based on a series of my [research notes]({{< ref research-wqe >}}) that I have been writing since September 2020.

The paper preprint is available on arXiv:
  [arXiv:2304.07265 [stat.ME]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07265).
The paper source code is available on GitHub:
  [AndreyAkinshin/paper-wqe](https://github.com/AndreyAkinshin/paper-wqe).
You can cite it as follows:

Abstract:

> In this paper, we consider a generic scheme that allows building weighted versions of various quantile estimators,
>   such as traditional quantile estimators based on linear interpolation of two order statistics,
>   the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator and its trimmed modification.
> The obtained weighted quantile estimators are especially useful
>   in the problem of estimating a distribution at the tail of a time series using quantile exponential smoothing.
> The presented approach can also be applied to other problems,
>   such as quantile estimation of weighted mixture distributions.
