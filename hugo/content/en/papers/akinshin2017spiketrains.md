## Abstract

> We consider a signal reconstruction problem for signals \$F\$ of the form \$ F(x)=\backslashsum\_\j=1\\^\d\a\_\j\\backslashdelta\backslashleft(x-x\_\j\\backslashright),\$ from their moments \$m\_k(F)=\backslashint x\^kF(x)dx.\$ We assume \$m\_k(F)\$ to be known for \$k=0,1,\backslashldots,N,\$ with an absolute error not exceeding \$\backslashepsilon \textgreater 0\$. We study the "geometry of error amplification" in reconstruction of \$F\$ from \$m\_k(F),\$ in situations where two neighboring nodes \$x\_i\$ and \$x\_\i+1\\$ near-collide, i.e \$x\_\i+1\-x\_i=h \backslashll 1\$. We show that the error amplification is governed by certain algebraic curves \$S\_\F,i\,\$ in the parameter space of signals \$F\$, along which the first three moments \$m\_0,m\_1,m\_2\$ remain constant.
