A nice write-up covering a workshop on scientific and technological thinking (2001).
Interesting speculations on the philosophy of science are mostly based on the metaphors of
  the [spherical horse]({{< ref 345b1b6e-c75a-4164-9999-c9519f1a309c >}}) and
  the [shared toothbrushes]({{< ref 3e2e8840-784d-41ed-8c01-5a880bd614c2 >}}).

## Abstract

> We briefly summarize some of the lessons learned in a workshop on cognitive studies of science and technology. Our purpose was to assemble a diverse group of practitioners to discuss the latest research, identify the stumbling blocks to advancement in this field, and brainstorm about directions for the future. Two questions became central themes. First, how can we combine artificial studies involving ‘spherical horses’ with fine-grained case studies of actual practice? Results obtained in the laboratory may have low applicability to real world situations. Second, how can we deal with academics’ attachments to their theoretical frameworks? Academics often like to develop unique ‘toothbrushes‘ and are reluctant to use anyone else’s. The workshop illustrated that toothbrushes can be shared and that spherical horses and fine-grained case studies can complement one another. Theories need to deal rigorously with the distributed character of scientific and technological problem solving. We hope this workshop will suggest directions more sophisticated theories might take.
