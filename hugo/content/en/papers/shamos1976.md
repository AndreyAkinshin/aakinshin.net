## Abstract

> In this paper we approach the analysis of statistics algorithms from a geometric viewpoint and use techniques from computational geometry to develop new, fast algorithms for computing familiar statistical quantities. Such fundamental procedures as sorting and selection play an important role in nonparametric estimation as well as in correlation and regression and we use known results to obtain lower bounds on the time required to perform various statistical tests. For some problems, computing the test statistic is NP-hard. While geometric insight is helpful in understanding statistical calculations, the reverse is also true-we employ statistical methods to analyze the average case of geometric al gorithms.
