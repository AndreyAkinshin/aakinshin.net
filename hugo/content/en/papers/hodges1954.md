## Abstract

> The distinction between statistical significance and material significance in hypotheses testing is discussed. Modifications of the customary tests, in order to test for the absence of material significance, are derived for several parametric problems, for the chi-square test of goodness of fit, and for Student's hypothesis. The latter permits one to test the hypothesis that the means of two normal populations of equal variance, do not differ by more than a stated amount.
