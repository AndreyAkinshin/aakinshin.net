The authors claim that treatment with n−3 polyunsaturated fatty acid reduces the risk of heart attacks.
The claim has been made using observational research without accounting for multiple confounding factors.
Correlation does not imply causation.

In {{< link d101056nejmoa1205409_2013 >}} (double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial),
  a similar study shows that there is no effect.

Discussed in {{< link reinhart-statistics-done-wrong >}} (page 84).
