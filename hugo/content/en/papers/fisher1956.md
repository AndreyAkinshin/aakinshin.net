## Abstract

> An explicit statement of the logical nature of statistical reasoning that has been implicitly required in the development and use of statistical techniques in the making of uncertain inferences and in the design of experiments. Included is a consideration of the concept of mathematical probability; a comparison of fiducial and confidence intervals; a comparison of the logic of tests of significance with the acceptance decision approach; and a discussion of the principles of prediction and estimation.
