## Abstract

> We show non-uniqueness of cycles in phase portraits of some odd-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems considered as models of gene networks regulated by negative feedbacks. We find geometric and analytic characteristics of these cycles and construct a graph, which describes qualitative behavior of trajectories of these dynamical systems.
