## Abstract

> Gene networks are sets of genes functioning in a coordinated manner. Their major components are the biopolymers DNA, RNA, and proteins. In this paper, we consider a small network with several genes (they can be considered standalone) and observe the concentration of the corresponding proteins. Researching the dynamic behavior of gene networks is a complicated problem. Therefore, we research the principles of their functioning on special hypothetical model objects. These models can be described by a nonlinear differential system. Symmetry is a very important property of living systems. The phenomenon of symmetry can be observed in completely different biological models. The analysis of gene networks model symmetry allows us to construct special methods to solve such standard problems as the problem of existence and stability of attractors, to build the graphical representation of the gene network phase portraits, to determine equilibrium points, to simulate trajectory, etc. Also we performed computer modeling and conducted simulation experiments with our models in R language to verify obtained results.
