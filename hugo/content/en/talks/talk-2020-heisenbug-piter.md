When we are talking about performance testing a lot of programmers only think about measurements and collecting metrics while analysis of metrics is more important. Understand how to use measured metrics correctly and making the most of them is not an easy way. During this session we will discuss the main tasks and difficulties of performance analysis: we'll talk about how to study raw data and summary metrics, how to apply statistical tests, compare performance distributions, write performance tests, analyze the history of measurements and choose right metrics.
