> Consider also that top-ranked journals, such as Nature and Science,
>   prefer to publish studies with groundbreaking results—meaning large effect sizes
>   in novel fields with little prior research.
> This is a perfect combination for chronic truth inflation.
> Some evidence suggests a correlation between
>   a journal’s impact factor (a rough measure of its prominence and importance)
>   and the factor by which its studies overestimate effect sizes.
> Studies that produce less “exciting” results are closer to the truth but less interesting to a major journal editor.
