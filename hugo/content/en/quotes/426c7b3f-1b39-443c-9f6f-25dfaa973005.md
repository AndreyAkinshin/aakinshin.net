> Although for quantitative data and means there is a direct correspondence between the confidence interval approach
>   and a t test ofthe null hypothesis at the associated level of statistical significance,
>   this is not exactly so for qualitative data and proportions.
> The reason is related to the use of different estimates of the standard error for
>   the usual tests of the null hypothesis from those given here for constructing confidence intervals.
> The lack of direct correspondence is small and should not result in changes of interpretation.
> In addition, more accurate confidence intervals can sometimes be obtained
>   by using estimates of the standard error of the sample statistic at the confidence limits themselves-such
>   as derived by Cornfield for relative risks.
