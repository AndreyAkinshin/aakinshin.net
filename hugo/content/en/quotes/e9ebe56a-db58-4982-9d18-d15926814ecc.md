> Of the nineteen papers published in the August 2008 issue of Nature Neuroscience,
>   seventeen papers (89%) used inferential statistics;
>   of these, only three (18%) had sufficient information to assess whether there was pseudoreplication.
> Of these three, two appeared to have pseudoreplication.
> Of the fourteen papers that used inferential statistics but did not provide sufficient information,
>   five (36%) were suspected of having pseudoreplication, but it was not possible to determine for certain.
