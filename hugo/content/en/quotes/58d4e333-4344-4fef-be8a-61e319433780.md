> **Methods** In 2011 we surveyed US obstetrics-gynecology residents
>   participating in the Council for Resident Education in Obstetrics and
>   Gynecology In-Training Examination about their statistical literacy and statistical literacy training.
>
> **Results** Our response rate was 95% (4713 of 4961).
> About two-thirds (2980 of 4713) of the residents rated their statistical literacy training as adequate.
> Female respondents were more likely to rate their statistical literacy training poorly,
>   with 25% (897 of 3575) indicating inadequate literacy compared with 17% (141 of 806)
>   of the male respondents (P < .001).
> Respondents performed poorly on 2 statistical literacy questions,
>   with only 26% (1222 of 4713) correctly answering a positive predictive value question
>   and 42% (1989 of 4173) correctly defining a P value.
> A total of 51% (2391 of 4713) of respondents reported receiving statistical literacy training through a journal club,
>   29% (1359 of 4713) said they had informal training,
>   15% (711 of 4713) said that they had statistical literacy training as part of a course,
>   and 11% (527 of 4713) said that they had no training.
