> The discovery of the ozone hole **was announced in 1985** by a British team working on the ground
>   with “conventional” instruments and examining its observations in detail.
> Only later, after reexamining the data transmitted by the TOMS instrument on NASA’s Nimbus 7 satellite,
>   was it found that **the hole had been forming for several years**.
> Why had nobody noticed it?
> The reason was simple:
>   the systems processing the TOMS data, designed in accordance with predictions derived from models,
>   which in turn were established on the basis of what was thought to be “reasonable”,
>   **had rejected the very (“excessively”) low values** observed above the Antarctic during the Southern spring.
> As far as the program was concerned, there must have been an operating defect in the instrument.
