> "Everyone knows" that confidence intervals contain all the information
>   to be found in significance tests and much more.
> They not only reveal the status of the trivial nil hypothesis but also about the status of non-nil null hypotheses
>   and thus help remind researchers about the possible operation of the crud factor.
> Yet they are rarely to be found in the literature.
> I suspect that the main reason they are not reported is that they are so embarrassingly large!
