> In theory, a comparison of two experimental effects requires a statistical test on their difference.
> In practice, this comparison is often based on an incorrect procedure involving two separate tests
>   in which researchers conclude that effects differ when one effect is significant (P < 0.05)
>   but the other is not (P > 0.05).
> We reviewed 513 behavioral, systems and cognitive neuroscience articles
>   in five top-ranking journals (Science, Nature, Nature Neuroscience, Neuron and The Journal of Neuroscience)
>   and found that 78 used the correct procedure and 79 used the incorrect procedure.
> An additional analysis suggests that incorrect analyses of interactions
>   are even more common in cellular and molecular neuroscience.
