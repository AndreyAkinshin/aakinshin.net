> A final, famous example dates back to 1933, when the field of mathematical statistics was in its infancy.
> Horace Secrist, a statistics professor at Northwestern University, published The Triumph of Mediocrity in Business,
>   which argued that unusually successful businesses tend to become less successful
>   and unsuccessful businesses tend to become more successful:
>   proof that businesses trend toward mediocrity.
> This was not a statistical artifact, he argued, but a result of competitive market forces.
> Secrist supported his argument with reams of data and numerous charts and graphs
>   and even cited some of Galton’s work in regression to the mean.
> Evidently, Secrist did not understand Galton’s point.
