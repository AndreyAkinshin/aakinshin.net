sourceTitle: "A Comprehensive Review of Reporting Practices in Psychological journals: Are Effect Sizes Really enough?"
hasNotes: false
---

> Over-reliance on significance testing has been heavily criticized in psychology.
> Therefore the American Psychological Association recommended
>   supplementing the p value with additional elements such as effect sizes, confidence intervals,
>   and considering statistical power seriously.
> This article elaborates the conclusions that can be drawn when these measures accompany the p value.
> An analysis of over 30 summary papers (including over 6,000 articles) reveals that, if at all,
>   only effect sizes are reported in addition to p’s (38%).
> Only every 10th article provides a confidence interval and statistical power is reported in only 3% of articles.
