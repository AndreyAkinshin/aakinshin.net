> Every experimental physicist knows those surprising and inexplicable apparent ‘effects’ which in his laboratory
>   can perhaps even be reproduced for some time, but which finally disappear without trace.
> Of course, no physicist would say in such a case that he had made a scientific discovery
>   (though he might try to rearrange his experiments so as to make the effect reproducible).
> Indeed the scientifically significant physical effect may be defined as that
>   which can be regularly reproduced by anyone who carries out the appropriate experiment in the way prescribed.
> No serious physicist would offer for publication, as a scientific discovery, any such ‘occult effect’,
>   as I propose to call it — one for whose reproduction he could give no instructions.
> The ‘discovery’ would be only too soon rejected as chimerical,
>   simply because attempts to test it would lead to negative results.
> (It follows that any controversy over the question whether events which are in principle unrepeatable
>   and unique ever do occur cannot be decided by science: it would be a metaphysical controversy.)
