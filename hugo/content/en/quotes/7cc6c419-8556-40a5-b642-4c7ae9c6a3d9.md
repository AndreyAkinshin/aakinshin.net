sourceTitle: "Why Even More Clinical Research Studies May Be False: Effect of Asymmetrical Handling of Clinically Unexpected Values"
hasNotes: false

> Imagine three researchers in separate laboratories around the world who believe that patients in two groups differ in their values of a variable. Each researcher proclaims high clinical and research standards. Dr A is particularly fastidious, taking care to remeasure any initial measurements where they are inconsistent with the clinical picture. Dr B is especially scrupulous about bias in research and tries to prevent even a few patients who have other intercurrent diseases from distorting results. Dr C realises that unaided clinical judgement may be poor at classifying patients and that test results may be better guidance.
