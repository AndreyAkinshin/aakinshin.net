> 1. Sample size planning is important to enhance cumulative knowledge in the discipline
>   as well as for the individual researcher.
> 2. Sample size planning can be based on a goal of achieving adequate statistical power,
>   or accurate parameter estimates, or both.
> 3. Researchers are actively involved in developing methods for sample size planning,
>   especially for complex designs and analyses.
> 4. Sample sizes necessary to achieve accurate parameter estimates will often be larger
>   than sample sizes necessary to detect even a small effect.
> 5. Sample sizes necessary to obtain accurate parameter estimates or power to detect small effects may often
>   require resources prohibitive to the individual researcher,
>   thus suggesting the desirability of study registries accompanied by meta-analytic methods.
