> In recent years there have been many advocates for statistical reform,
>   and naturally there is disagreement among them on the best method to address these problems.
> Some insist that p values, which I will show are frequently misleading and confusing, should be abandoned altogether;
>   others advocate a “new statistics” based on confidence intervals.
> Still others suggest a switch to new Bayesian methods that give more-interpretable results,
>   while others believe statistics as it’s currently taught is just fine but used poorly.
