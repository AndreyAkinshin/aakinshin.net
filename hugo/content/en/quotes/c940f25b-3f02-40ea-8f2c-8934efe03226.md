> It is difficult to give an objective assessment of the validity of a statistical analysis.
> Rather like medicine, statistics is an art, and there is rarely a unique correct approach.
> Rather judgement is necessary to select one of a number of possible analyses,
>   each with their own advantages and limitations.
> In my review I encountered many analyses which I would have tackled differently,
>   but where in my judgement the analysis as presented was perfectly acceptable.
> In writing this article I have attempted to confine my criticisms to points where
>   I believe that the vast majority of statisticians would agree that the approach adopted was not acceptable,
>   and indeed many statisticians would probably take a harder line than I have.
> My statistical philosophy leans towards being a realist rather than a purist,
>   and my research interests lie in the area of how to obtain the least biased results possible in areas
>   where perhaps for ethical or practical reasons randomization is not possible, or where missing data abound.
