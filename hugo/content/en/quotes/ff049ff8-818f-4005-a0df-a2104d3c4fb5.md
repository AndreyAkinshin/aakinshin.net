> Math is another possible explanation for why power calculations are so uncommon:
>   analytically calculating power can be difﬁcult or downright impossible.
> Techniques for calculating power are not frequently taught in intro statistics courses.
> And some commercially available statistical software does not come with power calculation functions.
> It is possible to avoid hairy mathematics by simply simulating thousands of artiﬁcial datasets
>   with the effect size you expect and running your statistical tests on the simulated data.
> The power is simply the fraction of datasets for which you obtain a statistically signiﬁcant result.
> But this approach requires programming experience, and simulating realistic data can be tricky.
