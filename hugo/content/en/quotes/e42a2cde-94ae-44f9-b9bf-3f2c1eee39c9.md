> Climate studies often involve comparisons between estimates of some parameter derived
>   from different observed and/or model-generated datasets.
> It is common practice to present estimates of two or more statistical quantities with error bars
>   about each representing a confidence interval.
> If the error bars do not overlap, it is presumed that there is a statistically significant difference between them.
> In general, such a procedure is not valid and usually results
>   in declaring statistical significance too infrequently.
> Simple examples that demonstrate the nature of this pitfall, along with some formulations, are presented.
> It is recommended that practitioners use standard hypothesis testing techniques
>   that have been derived from statistical theory rather than the ad hoc approach involving error bars.
