> A study with low statistical power has a reduced chance of detecting a true effect,
>   but it is less well appreciated that low power also reduces
>   the likelihood that a statistically significant result reflects a true effect.
> Here, we show that the average statistical power of studies in the neurosciences is very low.
> The consequences of this include overestimates of effect size and low reproducibility of results.
> There are also ethical dimensions to this problem, as unreliable research is inefficient and wasteful.
> Improving reproducibility in neuroscience is a key priority and requires attention to well-established
>   but often ignored methodological principles.
