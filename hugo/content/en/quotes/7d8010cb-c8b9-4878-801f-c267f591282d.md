> I believe that an observant statistician
>   who has had any considerable experience with applying the chi-square test repeatedly
>   will agree with my statement that, as a matterof observation,
>   when the numbersin the data are quite large, the P's tend to come out small.
> Having observed this, and on reflection, I make the following dogmatic statement,
>   referring for illustration to the normal curve:
>   "If the normal curve is fitted to a body of data representingany real observations
>   whatever of quantitiesin the physical world,
>   hen if the number of observationsis extremely large - for instance,
>   on the order of 200,000-the chi-square P will be small beyond any usual limit of significance."
