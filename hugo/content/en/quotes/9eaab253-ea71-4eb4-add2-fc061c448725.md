> The long-term impact of studies of statistical power is investigated using
>   J. Cohen's (1962) pioneering work as an example.
> We argue that the impact is nil; the power of studies in the same journal that Cohen reviewed
>   (now the Journal of Abnormal Psychology) has not increased over the past 24 years.
> In 1960 the median power (i.e., the probability that a significant result will be obtained if there is a true effect)
>   was .46 for a medium size effect, whereas in 1984 it was only .37.
> The decline of power is a result of alpha-adjusted procedures.
> Low power seems to go unnoticed: only 2 out of 64 experiments mentioned power, and it was never estimated.
> Nonsignificance was generally interpreted as confirmation of the null hypothesis
>   (if this was the research hypothesis),
>   although the median power was as low as .25 in these cases.
