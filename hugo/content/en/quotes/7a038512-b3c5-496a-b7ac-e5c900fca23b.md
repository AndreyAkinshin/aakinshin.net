> One problem arises from a misapplication of deductive syllogistic reasoning.
> Falk and Greenbaum (in press) called this the
>   "illusion of probabilistic proof by contradiction" or the "illusion of attaining improbability."
> Gigerenzer (1993) called it the "permanent illusion" and the "Bayesian Id's wishful thinking,"
>   part of the "hybrid logic" of contemporary statistical inference—a mishmash of Fisher and Neyman-Pearson,
>   with invalid Bayesian interpretation.
