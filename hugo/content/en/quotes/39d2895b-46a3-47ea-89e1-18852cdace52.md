> Multi-tasking (i.e. doing several things simultaneously)
>   has often been considered in terms of what people "do" and not necessarily in terms of what people "think about"
>   or how they allocate their attention among their tasks.
> The present research suggests that even when people are behaviorally focused on one task and are not multi-tasking,
>   their minds may not be com- pletely focused on the task at hand.
> In other words, multi-tasking may not only be due to competing simultaneous demands,
>   like receiving an email or a text message during a meeting,
>   but may also be a function of how the mind operates in a context
>   where people must manage multiple tasks, activities or responsibilities at the same time.
