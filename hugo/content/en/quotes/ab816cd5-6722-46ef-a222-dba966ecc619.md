> Several men have concerned themselves extensively with the transformation of frequency distributions, for instance, Edgeworth, Hapteyn, Arne Fisher, and H. L. Reitz. The first three of these men have been concerned with transformations as a means of extending the scope of the normal distribution and Gram-Charlier system as a method of description. Reitz has been more interested in the properties of the transformed distributions.
