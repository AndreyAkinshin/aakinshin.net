> It is not generally appreciated that the p value, as conceived by R. A. Fisher,
>   is not compatible with the Neyman-Pearson hypothesis test in which it has become embedded.
> The p value was meant to be a flexible inferential measure,
>   whereas the hypothesis test was a rule for behavior, not inference.
> The combination of the two methods has led to a reinterpretation of the p value simultaneously
>   as an "observed error rate" and as a measure of evidence.
> Both of these interpretations are problematic, and their combination has obscured
>   the important differences between Neyman and Fisher on the nature of the scientific method
>   and inhibited our understanding of the philosophic implications of the basic methods in use today.
> An analysis using another method promoted by Fisher, mathematical likelihood,
>   shows that the p value substantially overstates the evidence against the null hypothesis.
> Likelihood makes clearer the distinction between error rates and inferential evidence
>   and is a quantitative tool for expressing evidential strength
>   that is more appropriate for the purposes of epidemiology than the p value.
