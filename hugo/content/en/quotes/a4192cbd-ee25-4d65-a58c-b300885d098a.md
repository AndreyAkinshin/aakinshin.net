sourceTitle: "Hunter: Using Change Point Detection to Hunt for Performance Regressions"
hasNotes: false
---

> One of the teams using Hunter was afflicted with frequent change point messages via the Slack bot. After investigating these change points they discovered that the performance of the application hadnâ€™t changed, rather the change in benchmark results was caused by unstable hardware performance in a private data center. Changes of +- 10% for the median latency were typical.

> While Hunter can detect statistically significant changes in time series data, it is still not impervious to data that contains wildly fluctuating points such as that produced by running benchmarks on untuned hardware.
