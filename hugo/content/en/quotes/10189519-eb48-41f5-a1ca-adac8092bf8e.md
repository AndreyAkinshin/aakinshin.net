> Our survey of 423 negative clinical trials indicates that 55% of trials had too few participants
>   to detect a medium effect size in favor of the experimental over the standard treatment arm
>   for their primary end point with at least 80% statistical power.
> Although underpowered negative clinical trials have been widely reported in the general medical
>   and subspecialty literature, there are few reports relating to trials evaluating treatment of cancer.
> A review of 22 negative randomized oncology trials published in major general medical or oncology journals
>   during a 1-year period found that 16 trials (73%) lacked adequate statistical power to detect a 50% improvement
>   in median survival in favor of the experimental arm.
