> For myself, I am interested in science and in philosophy only because
>   I want to learn something about the riddle of the world in which we live,
>   and the riddle of man’s knowledge of that world.
> And I believe that only a revival of interest in these riddles can save the sciences and philosophy from
>   narrow specialization and from an obscurantist faith in the expert’s special skill,
>   and in his personal knowledge and authority;
>   a faith that so well fits our ‘post-rationalist’ and ‘post-critical’ age,
>   proudly dedicated to the destruction of the tradition of rational philosophy, and of rational thought itself.
