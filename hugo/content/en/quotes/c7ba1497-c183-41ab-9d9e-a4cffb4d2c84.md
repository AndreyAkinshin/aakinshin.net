sourceTitle: The Beta Error and Sample Size Determination in Clinical Trials in Emergency Medicine
hasNotes: false
---

> Failure to achieve statistical significance between interventions does not prove the absence of any difference.
> Proper planning of a clinical trial with attention to beta error and sample size determination allows
>   the critical investigator to acknowledge the probability of a type II error and therefore the probability
>   of detecting a clinically meaningful difference if one exists.
> The reader and clinician must be aware that negative trials may in fact be falsely negative,
>   and should look for specific reporting of alpha, beta, and $\Delta_c$ error to provide the details
>   of the reliability of such conclusions.
> Type II error should be as essential a requirement for publication, and as rigorously analyzed,
>   as the traditional and far more common type I (alpha) error.
