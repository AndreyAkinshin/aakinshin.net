> This is a Type M (magnitude) error (Gelman and Tuerlinckx, 2000):
>   the study is constructed in such a way that any statistically-significant finding will almost certainly be
>   a huge overestimate of the true effect.
> In addition there will be Type S (sign) errors,
>   in which the estimate will be in the opposite direction as the true effect.
