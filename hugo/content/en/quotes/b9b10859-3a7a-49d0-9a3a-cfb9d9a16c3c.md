> I have italicized the words ‘rational discussion’ and ‘critically’ in order to stress that
>   I equate the rational attitude and the critical attitude.
> The point is that, whenever we propose a solution to a problem,
>   we ought to try as hard as we can to overthrow our solution, rather than defend it.
> Few of us, unfortunately, practise this precept;
>   but other people, fortunately, will supply the criticism for us if we fail to supply it ourselves.
> Yet criticism will be fruitful only if we state our problem as clearly as we can
>   and put our solution in a sufficiently definite form — a form in which it can be critically discussed.
