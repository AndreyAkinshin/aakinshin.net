> We are inclined to think that as far as a particular hypothesis is concerned,
>   no test based upon the theory of probability can by itself provide
>   any valuable evidence of the truth or falsehood of that hypothesis.
>
> But we may look at the purpose of tests from another view-point.
> Without hoping to know whether each separate hypothesis is true or false,
>   we may search for rules to govern our behaviour with regard to them,
>   in following which we insure that, in the long run of experience, we shall not be too often wrong.
