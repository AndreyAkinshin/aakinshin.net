> The maximal between-study variance was more likely to be recorded early in the 44 eligible meta-analyses
>   of genetic associations than in the 37 meta-analyses of health care interventions (P = .013).
> At the time of the first heterogeneity assessment,
>   the most favorable-ever result in support of a specific association was more likely to appear than
>   the least favorable-ever result (22 vs. 10, P = .017);
>   the opposite was seen at the second heterogeneity assessment (15 vs. 5, P = .031).
> Such a sequence of extreme opposite results was not seen in the clinical trials meta-analyses.
> The estimated between-study variance decreased over time in genetic association studies (P = .010),
>   but not in clinical trials (P = .30).
