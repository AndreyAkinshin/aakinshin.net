> What are the statistical practices of articles published in journals with a high impact factor?
> Are there differences compared with articles published in journals with a somewhat lower impact factor
>   that have adopted editorial policies to reduce the impact of limitations of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing?
> To investigate these questions, the current study analyzed all articles related to
>   psychological, neuropsychological and medical issues,
>   published in 2011 in four journals with high impact factors:
>   Science, Nature, The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet,
>   and three journals with relatively lower impact factors:
>   Neuropsychology, Journal of Experimental Psychology-Applied and the American Journal of Public Health.
> Results show that Null Hypothesis Significance Testing without any use of
>   confidence intervals, effect size, prospective power and model estimation,
>   is the prevalent statistical practice used in articles published in Nature, 89%,
>   followed by articles published in Science, 42%.
