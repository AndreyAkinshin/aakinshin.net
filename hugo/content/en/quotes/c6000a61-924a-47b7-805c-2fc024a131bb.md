> Instead of asking “how many more crashes?” and the authors chose to ask
>   “are we sufficiently sure that the effect was not zero?”
> This substitution of questions led to all the subsequent entanglements.
> These can all be avoided by not testing statistical hypotheses
>   when the research question is about the effect of some treatment;
>   by returning to common sense and the mainstream of science and providing estimates of
>   effect magnitude and its standard error instead.
