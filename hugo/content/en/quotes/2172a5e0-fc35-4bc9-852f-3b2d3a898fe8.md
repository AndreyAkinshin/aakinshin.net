> From the viewpoint of applied computational complexity, statistics is a gold mine, for it provides a rich and extensive source of unalyzed algorithms and computational procedures. For the statistician, however, the search for efficient algorithms has not been of prime concerns for several reasons: First, the design of fast algorithms is a new and developing art. Second, until recently, the cost of obtaining data has been far greater than the cost of analyzing it. Now, hoever, speech and image processing provide information to statistical analysis programs rapidly and cheaply, so that fast analysis is of considerable important. Third, statisticians are properly concerned with the significance and effectiveness of the tests they perform, rather than with their cost. The result has been that the analysis of statistical algorithms remains largely ignored.
