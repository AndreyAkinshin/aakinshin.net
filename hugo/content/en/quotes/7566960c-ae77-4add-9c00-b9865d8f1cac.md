> Statisticians classically asked the wrong question — and were willing to answer with a lie,
>   one that was often a downright lie.
> They asked "Are the effects of A and B different?" and they were willing to answer "no."
>
> All we know about the world teaches us that the effects of A and B are always difference — in some decimal place —
>   for any A and B.
> Thus asking "Are the effects different?" is foolish.
>
> What we should be answering first is
>   "Can we tell the direction in which the effects of A differ from the effects of B?"
> In other words, can we be confident about the direction from A to B?
> Is it "up," "down" or "uncertain"?
>
> The third answer to this first question is that we are "uncertain about the direction" —
>   it is not, and never should be, that we "accept the null hypothesis."
