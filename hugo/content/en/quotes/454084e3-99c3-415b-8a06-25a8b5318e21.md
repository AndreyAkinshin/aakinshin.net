> Mapping raw data can lead to spurious spatial features.
> For example, regions can appear highly variable because of
>   small sample sizes in spatial sub-units (as in the radon example)
>   or small populations (as in the cancer example),
>   and these apparently variable regions contain a disproportionate number of
>   very high (or low) observed parameter values.
> Mapping posterior means leads to the reverse problems:
>   areas that appear too uniform because of small sample sizes or populations.
