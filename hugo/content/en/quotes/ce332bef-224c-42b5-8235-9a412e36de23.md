> When searching for a new resonance somewhere in a possible mass range,
>   the significance of observing a local excess of events must take into account
>   the probability of observing such an excess anywhere in the range.
> This is the so called “look elsewhere effect”.
> The effect can be quantified in terms of a trial factor,
>   which is the ratio between the probability of observing the excess at some fixed mass point,
>   to the probability of observing it anywhere in the range.
