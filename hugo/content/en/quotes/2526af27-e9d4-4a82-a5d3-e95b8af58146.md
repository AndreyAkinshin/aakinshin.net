> While at this point it seems impossible to quantify the relative contributions of the different factors
>   influencing the reliability of scientific publications,
>   the current empirical literature on the effects of journal rank provides
>   evidence supporting the following four conclusions:
> 1. Journal rank is a weak to moderate predictor of utility and perceived importance;
> 2. Journal rank is a moderate to strong predictor of both intentional and unintentional scientific unreliability
> 3. Journal rank is expensive, delays science and frustrates researchers;
> 4. Journal rank as established by IF violates even the most basic scientific standards,
>   but predicts subjective judgments of journal quality.
