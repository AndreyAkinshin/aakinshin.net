> The overlap method is simple, and it is convenient when lists or graphs of confidence intervals are presented.
> It can be useful as a quick and relatively rough method for exploratory data analysis.
> It should not be regarded as an optimal method for significance testing, however,
>   given its conservatism and low power relative to the standard method in the common situation
>   that we have considered.
> Thus, the overlap method should not be used for formal significance testing unless the data analyst
>   is aware of its deficiencies and unless the information needed to carry out
>   a more appropriate procedure is unavailable.
