sourceTitle: Contradicted and Initially Stronger Effects in Highly Cited Clinical Research
hasNotes: false

> Of 49 highly cited original clinical research studies, 45 claimed that the intervention was effective.
> Of these, 7 (16%) were contradicted by subsequent studies, 7 others (16%) had found effects
>   that were stronger than those of subsequent studies, 20 (44%) were replicated,
>   and 11 (24%) remained largely unchallenged.
> Five of 6 highlycited nonrandomized studies had been contradicted or had found
>   stronger effects vs 9 of 39 randomized controlled trials (P=.008).
> Among randomized trials, studies with contradicted or stronger effects were smaller (P=.009)
>   than replicated or unchallenged studies although there was no statistically significant difference
>   in their early or overall citation impact.
> Matched control studies did not have a significantly different share of refuted results than highly cited studies,
>   but they included more studies with “negative” results.
