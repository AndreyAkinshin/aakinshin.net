> We believe that good investigators who are aware of the issue will find that eliminating pseudoreplication
>   from their experiments is a relatively straightforward matter.
> The problems of pseudoreplication that we typically encounter in published studies are easily solvable,
>   and we see no reason that reviewers and editors should accept studies that fail to eliminate pseudoreplication.
> We certainly do not believe that absence of pseudoreplication should be the sole, or even the main,
>   criterion for evaluating experiments.
> Rather, we see the absence of pseudoreplication as representing a minimum requirement that should be met before
>   the merits of an experiment are evaluated.
