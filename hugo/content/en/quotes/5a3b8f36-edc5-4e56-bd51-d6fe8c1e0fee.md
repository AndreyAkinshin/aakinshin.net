> Meanwhile our eager-beaver researcher, undismayed by logic-of-science considerations and relying blissfully
>   on the “exactitude” of modem statistical hypothesis-testing, has produced a long publication list and been promoted
>   to a full professorship.
> In terms of his contribution to the enduring body of psychological knowledge, he has done hardly anything.
> His true position is that of a potent-but-sterile intellectual rake,
>   who leaves in his merry path a long train of ravished maidens but no viable scientific offspring.
