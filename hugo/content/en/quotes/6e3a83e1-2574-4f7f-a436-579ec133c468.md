> Most published reports of clinical studies begin with an abstract –
>   likely the first and perhaps only thing many clinicians,
>   the media and patients will read.
> Within that abstract, authors/investigators typically provide a brief summary of the results
>   and a 1–2 sentence conclusion.
> At times, the conclusion of one study will be different, even diametrically opposed,
>   to another despite the authors looking at similar data.
> In these cases, readers may assume that these individual authors somehow found dramatically different results.
> While these reported differences may be true some of the time,
>   radically diverse conclusions and ensuing controversies may simply be due to
>   tiny differences in confidence intervals combined with an over-reliance
>   and misunderstanding of a “statistically significant difference.”
> Unfortunately, this misunderstanding can lead to therapeutic uncertainty
>   for front-line clinicians when in fact the overall data on a particular issue is remarkably consistent.
