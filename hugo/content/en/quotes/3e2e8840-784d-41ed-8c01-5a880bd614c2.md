> Taxonomies and frameworks are like toothbrushes — no one wants to use anyone else’s.

The attribution of this quotation is ambiguous.
A nice historical overview of the quote can be found in
  [A useless history of the “Frameworks are Like Toothbrushes” quote](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/useless-history-frameworks-like-toothbrushes-quote-jonathan-scaccia/).
While {{< link gorman2001 >}} is one of the first appearances of the quote,
  this metaphor was especially popularized in [The Toothbrush Problem](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/the-toothbrush-problem) by Walter Mischel.
Occasionally, it is used in other works (e.g., see {{< link elson2023 >}}).
