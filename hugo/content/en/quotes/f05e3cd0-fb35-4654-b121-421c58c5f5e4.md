> Let us suppose that in a research field there are no true findings at all to be discovered.
> History of science teaches us that scientific endeavor has often in the past wasted effort
>   in fields with absolutely no yield of true scientific information, at least based on our current understanding.
> In such a “null field,” one would ideally expect
>   all observed effect sizes to vary by chance around the null in the absence of bias.
> The extent that observed findings deviate from what is expected
>   by chance alone would be simply a pure measure of the prevailing bias.
