> Scrutiny of the details of previous work’s measures is necessary to both inform
>   how we should interpret existing findings and to increase measures’ future reuse potential.
> Transparency about the fine grain details of our measures allows others to reuse them with fidelity,
>   and allows for the fidelity of measures to be checked between studies.
> These aspects of transparency and their scientific benefits have yet to be tapped by our field.
> If we want to build a cumulative evidence base in psychology,
>   we need to standardise our measures and protocols.
> Psychologists need to stop remixing and recycling, and start reusing (measures, not toothbrushes).
