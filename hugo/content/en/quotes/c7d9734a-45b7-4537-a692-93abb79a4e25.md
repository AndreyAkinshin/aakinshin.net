> Attempting to capitalize on Huff’s respected status,
>   the tobacco industry commissioned him to testify before Congress and then to write a book,
>   tentatively titled 'How to Lie with Smoking Statistics',
>   covering the many statistical and logical errors alleged to be found in the surgeon general’s report.
> Huff completed a manuscript, for which he was paid more than $9,000
>   (roughly $60,000 in 2014 dollars)
>   by tobacco companies and which was positively reviewed by University of Chicago statistician
>   (and paid tobacco industry consultant) K.A. Brownlee.
> Although it was never published, it’s likely that Huff’s friendly,
>   accessible style would have made a strong impression on the public,
>   providing talking points for watercooler arguments.
