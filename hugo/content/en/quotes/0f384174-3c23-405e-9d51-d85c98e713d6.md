> In summary, we conducted a randomized trial of n−3 fatty acids in a large population of patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors but no history of myocardial infarction. The trial incorporated systematic efforts to optimize medical therapies and control cardiovascular risk factors. On the basis of the results, we conclude that there was no significant benefit of n−3 fatty acids in reducing the risk of death from cardiovascular causes or hospital admission for cardiovascular causes.
