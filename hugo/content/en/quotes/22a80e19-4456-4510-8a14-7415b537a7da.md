> Little is known about researchersâ€™ understanding of confidence intervals (CIs) and standard error (SE) bars.
> Authors of journal articles in psychology, behavioral neuroscience, and medicine
>   were invited to visit a Web site where they adjusted a figure until they judged 2 means, with error bars,
>   to be just statistically significantly different (p < .05).
> Results from 473 respondents suggest that many leading researchers have severe misconceptions about
>   how error bars relate to statistical significance, do not adequately distinguish CIs and SE bars,
>   and do not appreciate the importance of whether the 2 means are independent
>   or come from a repeated measures design.
> Better guidelines for researchers and less ambiguous graphical conventions
>   are needed before the advantages of CIs for research communication can be realized.
