> It appears that medical authors feel the need to make black and white conclusions
>   when their data almost never allows for such dichotomous statements.
> This is particularly true when comparing results to similar studies with largely overlapping CIs.
> Virtually all of the conclusion confusion discussed in this paper can be linked to slavish adherence
>   to an arbitrary threshold for statistical significance.
> Even if the threshold is reasonable, it still cannot be used to make dichotomous conclusions.
