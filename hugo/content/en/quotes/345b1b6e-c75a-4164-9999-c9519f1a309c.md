> A multimillionaire offered a prize for predicting the outcome of a horse race to a stockbreeder, a geneticist, and a physicist. The stockbreeder said there were too many variables, the geneticist could not make a prediction about any particular horse, but the physicist claimed the prize, saying he could make the prediction to many decimal placesâ€”provided it were a perfectly spherical horse moving through a vacuum.
