> You may say, “But, Meehl, R. A. Fisher was a genius, and we all know how valuable his stuff has been in agronomy.
> Why shouldn’t it work for soft psychology?”
> Well, I am not intimidated by Fisher’s genius, because my complaint is not in the field of mathematical statistics,
>   and as regards inductive logic and philosophy of science,
>   it is well-known that Sir Ronald permitted himself a great deal of dogmatism.
> I remember my amazement when the late Rudolf Carnap said to me, the first time I met him,
>   “But, of course, on this subject Fisher is just mistaken: surely you must know that.”
> My statistician friends tell me that it is not clear just
>   how useful the significance test has been in biological science either,
>   but I set that aside as beyond my competence to discuss.
