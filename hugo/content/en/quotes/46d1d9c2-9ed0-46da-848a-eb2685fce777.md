> It was excusable to make a mistake, although if you made too many egregious ones you would not be well accepted;
>   but the unpardonable sin was to refuse to recognize that you had committed a fallacy,
>   formal or material, when it was pointed out.
> A close second major sin would be to keep committing the same fallacy over and over again
>   and having to be reminded of it.
