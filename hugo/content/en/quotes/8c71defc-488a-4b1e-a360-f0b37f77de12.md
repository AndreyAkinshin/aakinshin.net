> To begin, distributions are never normal.
> For some this seems obvious, hardly worth mentioning,
>   but an aphorism given by Cramér (1946) and attributed
>   to the mathematician Poincaré remains relevant:
>   “Everyone believes in the [normal] law of errors,
>   the experimenters because they think it is a mathematical theorem,
>   the mathematicians because they think it is an experimental fact.”
