> We have argued that the excessive use of hypothesis testing at the expense of more informative approaches
>   to data interpretation is an unsatisfactory way of assessing
>   and presenting statistical findings from medical studies.
> We prefer the use of confidence intervals, which present the results directly on the scale of data measurement.
> We have also suggested a notation for confidence intervals which is intended to force clarity of meaning.
> Confidence intervals, which also have a link to the outcome of hypothesis tests,
>   should become the standard method for presenting the statistical results of major findings.
