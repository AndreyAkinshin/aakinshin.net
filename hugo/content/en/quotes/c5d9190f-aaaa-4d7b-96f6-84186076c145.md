> Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects
>   with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be)
>   or replicates are not statistically independent.
> In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to
>   the hypothesis being considered.
> Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed
>   that pseudoreplication occurred in 27% of them,
>   or 48% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics.
> The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals.
