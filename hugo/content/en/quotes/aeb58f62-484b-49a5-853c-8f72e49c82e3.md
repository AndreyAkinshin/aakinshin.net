> An important problem exists in the interpretation of modern medical research data:
>   Biological understanding and previous research play little formal role
>   in the interpretation of quantitative results.
> This phenomenon is manifest in the discussion sections of research articles
>   and ultimately can affect the reliability of conclusions.
> The standard statistical approach has created this situation by promoting the illusion that conclusions
>   can be produced with certain “error rates,” without consideration of information from outside the experiment.
> This statistical approach, the key components of which are P values and hypothesis tests,
>   is widely perceived as a mathematically coherent approach to inference.
> There is little appreciation in the medical community that the methodology is an amalgam of incompatible elements,
>   whose utility for scientific inference has been
>   the subject of intense debate among statisticians for almost 70 years.
> This article introduces some of the key elements of that debate
>   and traces the appeal and adverse impact of this methodology to the P value fallacy,
>   the mistaken idea that a single number can capture both the long-run outcomes of an experiment
>   and the evidential meaning of a single result.
> This argument is made as a prelude to the suggestion that another measure of evidence should be used—the Bayes factor,
>   which properly separates issues of long-run behavior from evidential strength
>   and allows the integration of background knowledge with statistical findings.
