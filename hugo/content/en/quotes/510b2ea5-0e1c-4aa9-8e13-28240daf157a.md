> Confusion surrounding the reporting and interpretation of results of classical statistical tests
>   is widespread among applied researchers, most of whom erroneously believe
>   that such tests are prescribed by a single coherent theory of statistical inference.
> This is not the case: Classical statistical testing is an anonymous hybrid of the competing
>   and frequently contradictory approaches formulated by R. A. Fisher on the one hand,
>   and Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson on the other.
> In particular, there is a widespread failure to appreciate
>   the incompatibility of Fisher’s evidential p value with the Type I error rate, α,
>   of Neyman–Pearson statistical orthodoxy.
> The distinction between evidence (p’s) and error (α ’s) is not trivial.
> Instead, it reflects the fundamental differences between
>   Fisher’s ideas on significance testing and inductive inference,
>   and Neyman–Pearson’s views on hypothesis testing and inductive behavior.
> The emphasis of the article is to expose this incompatibility, but we also briefly note a possible reconciliation.
