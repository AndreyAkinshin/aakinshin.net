> It may be asked if testing for normality and, when necessary,
>   correction for universal non-normality is worth the trouble.
> To answer this question it is desirable to have regard to the logical position of the statistician,
>   concerned with drawing inferences from samples
>   whose characteristic approach may be defined as *reductio ad paene absurdum*:
>   if an event is highly improbable it must be regarded for practical purposes as impossible.
