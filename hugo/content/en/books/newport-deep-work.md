It's a fine book, but some parts are a little dry and boring.
Main insights are quite basic and common for {{< link gtd >}} books, examples are lengthy.

The book consists of two parts: "The Idea" and "The Rules".

The first part covers the general philosophy behind the concept of deep work.
Deep work is a state of mind,
  in which one is extremely focused and productive and is capable of achieving a lot within a short period.
True deep work is a rare mental state, and one should train their skills to develop an ability to enter it.

The second part is mostly a set of practical recommendations, most of which are classic:

* Quit social media, disable notifications and messengers
* Schedule a day in advance, and allocate time for deep work (max: 4-5 hours)
* Set up rituals for deep work (start, end); shutdown ritual at the end of the day
* Artifical deadlines
* Boredom - a useful exercise for training life without distractions
* Review all activities and remove everything that doesn't justify time spent
* Setting a cutoff point (Don't do any work after xx:yy pm)
* Productive meditation: think about a dedicated problem during a walk/run/cleaning and don't get distracted

The author introduces the following classification of various regimes of deep work:

* Bimodal philosophy: live as usual, but sometimes go to the woods for a month of deep work
* Rhythmic philosophy: live by the schedule, allocate n hours for deep work daily
* Journalist philosophy: be ready to switch to deep work at any moment once there is an opportunity for that

The introduced deep work and shallow work
  are similar concepts to hyperfocus and scatterfocus from {{< link bailey-hyperfocus >}}.

Most references are to online resources, not so much to scientific papers.

There are shallow discussions of some papers like {{< link leroy2009 >}} and {{< link masicampo2011 >}}.
