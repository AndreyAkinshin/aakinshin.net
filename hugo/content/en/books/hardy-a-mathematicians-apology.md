A relatively short essay, in which G.H. Hardy expresses his views on mathematics, aesthetics, and life in general
  mixed with his autobiography notes.
He wrote this essay at age 62, and sometimes it feels like "an old man yells at cloud,"
  while it is still quite interesting to read.
This write-up also fragmentally covers stories of Hardy's close friends including Ramanujan and Littlewood.
