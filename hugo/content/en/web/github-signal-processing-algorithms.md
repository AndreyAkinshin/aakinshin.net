> A suite of algorithms implementing [Energy Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_distance), [E-Divisive with Means](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.4933.pdf) and [Generalized ESD Test for Outliers](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35h3.htm) in python. See [The Use of Change Point Detection to Identify Software Performance Regressions in a Continuous Integration System](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3358960.3375791) and [Creating a Virtuous Cycle in Performance Testing at MongoDB](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3427921.3450234) for background on the development and use of this library.
