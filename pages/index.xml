He is the project lead of BenchmarkDotNet (the most popular .NET library for benchmarking) and perfolizer (performance analysis toolkit); the author of Pro .NET Benchmarking (a book about good practices of performance measurements).
Currently, Andrey is a Senior Performance Engineer in JetBrains Rider (a cross-platform .NET IDE based on the IntelliJ platform and ReSharper). He is also an ex Microsoft .NET MVP and a silver medalist of ACM ICPC.
Andrey is a Ph.D. in computer science and mathematics. His current primary research area is mathematical statistics. Previously, he worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Weizmann Institute of Science.</description></item><item><title>Blog posts BibTeX references</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts-bib/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts-bib/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Pro .NET Benchmarking</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/prodotnetbenchmarking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/prodotnetbenchmarking/</guid><description>Learn how to measure application performance and analyze the results! Use this in-depth guide to correctly design benchmarks, measure key performance metrics of .NET applications, and analyze results. This book presents dozens of case studies to help you understand complicated benchmarking topics. You will avoid common pitfalls, control the accuracy of your measurements, and improve performance of your software. Author Andrey Akinshin has maintained BenchmarkDotNet (the most popular .NET library for benchmarking) for five years and covers common mistakes that developers usually make in their benchmarks. This book includes not only .NET-specific content but also essential knowledge about performance measurements which can be applied to any language or platform (common benchmarking methodology, statistics, and low-level features of modern hardware). With this book, you will learn: Be aware of the best practices for writing benchmarks and performance tests Avoid the common benchmarking pitfalls Know the hardware and software factors that affect application performance Analyze performance measurements Apress Amazon US Amazon CA Amazon UK Amazon DE Amazon FR Amazon ES Amazon JP Springer Google Books O’Reilly GoodReads ResearchGate Examples (GitHub) Errata (GitHub) Content The book contains nine chapters:
Chapter 1 “Introducing Benchmarking”
This chapter contains some basic information about benchmarking and other performance investigations, including benchmarking goals and requirements. We will also discuss performance spaces and why it’s so important to analyze benchmark results. Chapter 2 “Common Benchmarking Pitfalls”
This chapter contains 15 examples of common mistakes that developers usually make during benchmarking. Each example is pretty small (so, you can easily understand what’s going on), but all of them demonstrate important problems and explain how to resolve them. Chapter 3 “How Environment Affects Performance”
This chapter explains why the environment is so important and introduces a lot of terms that will be used in subsequent chapters. You will find 12 case studies that demonstrate how minor changes in the environment may significantly affect application performance.</description></item><item><title>Research projects</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/research/</guid><description>Research projects Google Scholar ORCID ResearchGate arXiv Web of Science Scopus This page aggregates results from some of my research projects:
Statistical performance analysis Software benchmarking Mathematical models of gene networks Digital signal processing Statistical performance analysis This project aims to develop advanced statistical procedures for automatic analysis of software performance measurements. This included various location estimators, dispersion estimators, quantile estimators, effect size estimators, density estimators, change point detectors, outlier detectors, and multimodality detectors. The goal is to provide a set of non-parametric, robust, and efficient approaches that are applicable to software performance distributions.
I regularly share my preliminary research notes in the form of blog posts (165).

Since 2013, I have been working on developing BenchmarkDotNet (8K+ GitHub stars, 15K+ dependent GitHub projects, 18M+ NuGet downloads). This .NET library helps to transform methods into benchmarks, track their performance, and share reproducible measurement experiments. In the context of the statistical performance analysis project, I&amp;rsquo;m working on the next-generation statistical engine for performance measurement analysis.</description></item></channel></rss>
