  abstract = {Traditional quantile estimators that are based on one or two order statistics are a common way to estimate distribution quantiles based on the given samples. These estimators are robust, but their statistical efficiency is not always good enough. A more efficient alternative is the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator which uses a weighted sum of all order statistics. Whereas this approach provides more accurate estimations for the light-tailed distributions, it’s not robust. To be able to customize the tradeoff between statistical efficiency and robustness, we could consider a trimmed modification of the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator. In this approach, we discard order statistics with low weights according to the highest density interval of the beta distribution.}

abstract = {We consider a reconstruction problem for “spike-train” sig nals F of the a priori known form F ( x ) = ∑ d j =1 a j $\delta$ ( x − x j ) , from their moments m k ( F ) = ∫ x k F ( x ) dx. We assume m k ( F ) to be known for k = 0 , 1 , . . . , 2 d − 1 , with an absolute error not exceeding ǫ {\textgreater} 0. This problem is essentially equivalent to solving the Prony system ∑ d j =1 a j x k j = m k ( F ) , k = 0 , 1 , . . . , 2 d − 1 . We study the “geometry of error amplification” in reconstruc tion of F from m k ( F ) , in situations where the nodes x 1 , . . . , x d near-collide, i.e. form a cluster of size h ≪ 1. We show that in this case error amplification is governed by the “Prony leaves” S q F, in the parameter space of signals F , along which the first q + 1 moments remain constant. On this base we produce accurate , up to the constants, lower and upper bounds on the worst case r econstruction error, and show how the Prony leaves can help in improving rec onstruction accuracy.},

abstract = {We consider Fourier reconstruction problem for signals F, which are linear combinations of shifted delta-functions. We assume the Fourier transform of F to be known on the frequency interval [-N,N], with an absolute error not exceeding e {\textgreater} 0. We give an absolute lower bound (which is valid with any reconstruction method) for the "worst case" reconstruction error of F in situations where the nodes (i.e. the positions of the shifted delta-functions in F) are known to form an l elements cluster of a size h {\textless}{\textless} 1. Using "decimation" reconstruction algorithm we provide an upper bound for the reconstruction error, essentially of the same form as the lower one. Roughly, our main result states that for N*h of order of (2l-1)-st root of e the worst case reconstruction error of the cluster nodes is of the same order as h, and hence the inside configuration of the cluster nodes (in the worst case scenario) cannot be reconstructed at all. On the other hand, decimation algorithm reconstructs F with the accuracy of order of 2l-st root of e.},

abstract = {Gene networks are sets of genes functioning in a coordinated manner, their major components are the biopolymers DNA, RNA, and proteins. In this work, we consider a small network with several genes (they can be considered standalone) and observe the concentration of the corresponding proteins. Studying the dynamic behavior of gene networks is a complicated problem. Therefore, we research the principles of their functioning on special hypothetical model. These models can be describe by nonlinear system of differential equations. We are very interested in the questions on existence and stability of attractors in such models. Particular attention is paid to some multidimensional symmetric systems with negative and positive feedbacks. These systems are studied with a specially developed algorithm, which reduces them to a single equation with delayed argument. Cycles in this equation searched by Andronov-Hopf theorem and stability analyzes using the first Lyapunov coefficient. Computer modelling and numerical experiments with our models has been implemented in our special computer program called PhasePortraitAnalyzer. The mathematical core is developed in R, and the interface part is created using C{\#} + WPF. Its software can build the graphical representation of the gene networks phase portraits, search equilibrium points, simulate the trajectory and perform other calculations for analyzing the target system. We can prove the correctness of the numerical solutions using some theorems on topology of the models.},
