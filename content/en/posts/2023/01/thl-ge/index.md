In the [previous post]({{< ref thl-bp >}}), we introduced
  the trimmed Hodges-Lehman location estimator.
For a sample $\mathbf{x} = \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \}$,
  it is defined as follows:

$$
\operatorname{THL}(\mathbf{x}, k) = \underset{k < i < j \leq n - k}{\operatorname{median}}\biggl(\frac{x_{(i)} + x_{(j)}}{2}\biggr).
$$

We also derived the exact expression for its asymptotic and finite-sample breakdown point values.
In this post, we explore its Gaussian efficiency.
