Since the beginning of previous year, I have been working on building a quantile estimator
  that provides an optimal trade-off between statistical efficiency and robustness.
At the end of the year, I [published]({{< ref preprint-thdqe >}}) the corresponding preprint
  where I presented a description of such an estimator:
  [arXiv:2111.11776 [stat.ME]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11776).
The paper source code is available on GitHub:
  [AndreyAkinshin/paper-thdqe](https://github.com/AndreyAkinshin/paper-thdqe).

Finally, the paper was published in *Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation*.
You can cite it as follows:

  abstract = {Traditional quantile estimators that are based on one or two order statistics are a common way to estimate distribution quantiles based on the given samples. These estimators are robust, but their statistical efficiency is not always good enough. A more efficient alternative is the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator which uses a weighted sum of all order statistics. Whereas this approach provides more accurate estimations for the light-tailed distributions, itâ€™s not robust. To be able to customize the tradeoff between statistical efficiency and robustness, we could consider a trimmed modification of the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator. In this approach, we discard order statistics with low weights according to the highest density interval of the beta distribution.}
