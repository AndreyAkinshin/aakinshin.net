**Update: the [final paper]({{< ref pub-thdqe >}}) was published in *Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation* (DOI: [10.1080/03610918.2022.2050396](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03610918.2022.2050396)).**

Since the beginning of this year, I have been working on building a quantile estimator
  that provides an optimal trade-off between statistical efficiency and robustness.
Finally, I have built such an estimator.
A paper preprint is available on arXiv:
  [arXiv:2111.11776 [stat.ME]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11776).
The paper source code is available on GitHub:
