# Library

I enjoy the concept of having a personal library, but keeping a physical one is challenging.
So, I’ve created a virtual library.
This page contains a list of some books and papers I’ve read with occasional notes and reviews.
Currently, the list is quite incomplete, but I’m slowly and steadily expanding it using my old archive notes.
Ratings usually reflect my perception at the moment of reading and can be changed later.
Sorted first by rating, then by title.
