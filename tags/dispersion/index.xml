The most famous one is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">standard deviation&lt;/a>.
The standard deviation is the most popular way to describe the spread around the mean when
you work with normally distributed data.
However, if you work with non-normal distributions, this metric may be misleading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the world of non-parametric distributions,
the most common measure of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency">central tendency&lt;/a> is the median.
For the median, you can describe dispersion using the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation">median absolute deviation around the median&lt;/a> (MAD).
It works great if the median is the only &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_statistics">summary statistic&lt;/a> that you care about.
However, if you work with multimodal distributions
(they can be detected using the &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/lowland-multimodality-detection/">lowland multimodality detector&lt;/a>),
you may be interested in other quantiles as well.
So, it makes sense to learn how to describe dispersion around the given quantile.
Which metric should we choose?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, I came up with a great solution to this problem.
We can generalize the median absolute deviation into the quantile absolute deviation (QAD) around the given quantile based on the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator.
I will show how to calculate it, how to interpret it, and how to get insights about distribution properties
from images like this one:&lt;/p>
