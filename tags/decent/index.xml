Abstract A new distribution-free estimator Qp of the pth population quantile is formulated, where Qp is a linear combination of order statistics admitting a jackknife variance estimator having excellent properties. The small sample efficiency of Qp is studied under a variety of light and heavy-tailed symmetric and asymmetric distributions. For the distributions and values of p studied, Qp is generally substantially more efficient than the traditional estimator based on one or two order statistics.

Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial Decent sample size: 1383 events; 11200 patients Claimed power: 90% Detailed results, confidence intervals are provided I found protocol here, but it&amp;rsquo;s in Italian. I&amp;rsquo;ve found the raw data Discussed in Statistics Done Wrong (page 84).
