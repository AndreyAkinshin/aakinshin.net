Unfortunately, it was designed for the normal distribution,
which may make it a misleading measure in the non-normal case.
And the real distributions are &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/tags/normality/">never normal&lt;/a>.
When we discuss &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/library/quotes/ca964333-044c-4fec-8d89-145921696525/">deviations from normality&lt;/a>,
we should treat the illusion of normality not as an atomic mental construction,
but rather as a set of independent assumptions, each of which may be violated independently.
In this post, I take a look at what kind of issues we may have when the symmetry assumption is heavily violated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DoubleMAD outlier detector based on the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/harrell-davis-double-mad-outlier-detector/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/harrell-davis-double-mad-outlier-detector/</guid><description>&lt;p>Outlier detection is an important step in data processing.
Unfortunately, if the distribution is not normal (e.g., right-skewed and heavy-tailed), it&amp;rsquo;s hard to choose
a robust outlier detection algorithm that will not be affected by tricky distribution properties.
During the last several years, I tried many different approaches, but I was not satisfied with their results.
Finally, I found an algorithm to which I have (almost) no complaints.
It&amp;rsquo;s based on the &lt;em>double median absolute deviation&lt;/em> and the &lt;em>Harrell-Davis quantile estimator&lt;/em>.
In this post, I will show how it works and why it&amp;rsquo;s better than some other approaches.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
