The bug is a tricky one because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow me to debug my application on Mondays. I&amp;rsquo;m serious right now: the debug mode doesn&amp;rsquo;t work every Monday. Furthermore, the bug literally tell me: &amp;ldquo;Happy Monday!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, the story. It was a wonderful Sunday evening, no signs of trouble. We planned to release a new version of our software (a minor one, but it includes some useful features). Midnight on the clock. Suddenly, I came up with the idea that we have a minor bug that should be fixed. It requires a few lines of code and 10 minutes to do it. And I decided to write needed logic before I go to sleep. I open VisualStudio, lunch build, and wait. But something goes wrong, because I get the following error:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Error connecting to the pipe server.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Hmm. It is a strange error.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
