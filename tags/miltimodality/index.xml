a popular measure family is the effect sizes based on differences between means (difference family).
When the normality assumption is satisfied, this approach works well thanks to classic measures of effect size
like Cohen&amp;rsquo;s d, Glass&amp;rsquo; Î”, or Hedges&amp;rsquo; g.
With slight deviations from normality, &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/nonparametric-effect-size2/">robust alternatives&lt;/a> may be considered.
To build such a measure, it&amp;rsquo;s enough to upgrade classic measures by
replacing the sample mean with a robust measure of central tendency and
replacing the standard deviation with a robust measure of dispersion.
However, it might not be enough in the case of large deviations from normality.
In this post, I briefly discuss the problem of effect size evaluation in the context of multimodal distributions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
