Based on the given sample, it allows estimating the probability density function (PDF) of the underlying distribution.
Here is an example of KDE for &lt;code>x = {3.82, 4.61, 4.89, 4.91, 5.31, 5.6, 5.66, 7.00, 7.00, 7.00}&lt;/code>
(normal kernel, Sheather &amp;amp; Jones bandwidth selector):&lt;/p>

&lt;p>KDE is a simple and straightforward way to build a PDF, but it&amp;rsquo;s not always the best one.
In addition to my &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/kde-bw/">concerns about bandwidth selection&lt;/a>,
continuous use of KDE creates an illusion that all distributions are smooth and continuous.
In practice, it&amp;rsquo;s not always true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the above picture, the distribution looks pretty continuous.
However, the picture hides the fact that we have three &lt;code>7.00&lt;/code> elements in the original sample.
With continuous distributions, the probability of getting tied observations (that have the same value) is almost zero.
If a sample contains ties, we are most likely working with
either a discrete distribution or a mixture of discrete and continuous distributions.
A KDE for such a sample may significantly differ from the actual PDF.
Thus, this technique may mislead us instead of providing insights about the true underlying distribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, we discuss the usage of PDF and PMF with continuous and discrete distributions.
Also, we look at examples of corrupted density estimation plots for distributions with discrete features.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
