are &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/rousseeuw-croux-finite-efficiency/">efficient&lt;/a> alternatives to the median absolute deviation ($\operatorname{MAD}_n$).
While all three estimators have the same breakdown point of $50\%$,
$S_n$ and $Q_n$ have higher statistical efficiency than $\operatorname{MAD}_n$.
The asymptotic Gaussian efficiency values of $\operatorname{MAD}_n$, $S_n$, and $Q_n$
are $37\%$, $58\%$, and $82\%$ respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using scale constants, we can make $S_n$ and $Q_n$ consistent estimators for the standard deviation under normality.
The asymptotic values of these constants are well-known.
However, for finite-samples, only approximated scale constants are known.
In this post, we provide refined values of these constants with higher accuracy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Finite-sample efficiency of the Rousseeuw-Croux estimators</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/rousseeuw-croux-finite-efficiency/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/rousseeuw-croux-finite-efficiency/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Rousseeuw-Croux $S_n$ and $Q_n$ estimators are robust and efficient measures of scale.
Their breakdown points are equal to $0.5$ which is also the breakdown point of the median absolute deviation (MAD).
However, their statistical efficiency values are much better than the efficiency of MAD.
To be specific, the MAD asymptotic relative Gaussian efficiency against the standard deviation is about $37\%$,
whereas the corresponding values for $S_n$ and $Q_n$ are $58\%$ and $82\%$ respectively.
Although these numbers are quite impressive, they are only &lt;em>asymptotic&lt;/em> values.
In practice, we work with finite samples.
And the &lt;em>finite-sample efficiency&lt;/em> could be much lower than the asymptotic one.
In this post, we perform a simulation study in order to obtain the actual finite-sample efficiency values
for these two estimators.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
