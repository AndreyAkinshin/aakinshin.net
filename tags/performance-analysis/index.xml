from benchmarking to the internals of modern runtimes, operating systems, and hardware.
Surprisingly, the most difficult challenges in performance analysis are not about programming,
they are about mathematical statistics!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many software developers can drill into performance problems and implement excellent optimizations,
but they are not always know how to correctly verify these optimizations.
This may not look like a problem in the case of a single performance investigation.
However, the situation became worse when developers try to set up an infrastructure that
should automatically find performance problems or prevent degradations from merging.
In order to make such an infrastructure reliable and useful,
it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to achieve an extremely low false-positive rate (otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s not trustable)
and be able to detect most of the degradations (otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s not so useful).
It&amp;rsquo;s not easy if you don&amp;rsquo;t know which statistical approaches should be used.
If you try to google it, you may find thousands of papers about statistics,
but only a small portion of them really works in practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I want to share some approaches that I use for performance analysis in everyday life.
I have been analyzing performance distributions for the last seven years,
and I have found a lot of approaches, metrics, and tricks which nice to have
in your statistical toolbox.
I would not say that all of them are must have to know,
but they can definitely help you to improve the reliability of your statistical checks
in different problems of performance analysis.
Consider the below list as a letter to a younger version of myself with a brief list of topics that are good to learn.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
