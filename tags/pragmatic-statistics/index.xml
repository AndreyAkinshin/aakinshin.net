So many different approaches, so many different opinions, so many arguments, so many person-years of wasted time,
and so many flawed peer-reviewed papers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we want from statistics is an easy-to-use tool that would nudge us toward asking the right questions
and then straightforwardly guide us on how to design proper and relevant statistical procedures.
What we have is a bunch of vaguely described sets of strange equations,
a few arbitrarily chosen magical numbers as thresholds,
and no clear understanding of what to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the scientific community, there are a lot of adherents of
&lt;em>Frequentist&lt;/em> statistics (both Neyman-Pearson and Fisherian),
&lt;em>Bayesian&lt;/em> statistics,
&lt;em>Likelihood&lt;/em> statistics,
&lt;em>Nonparametric&lt;/em> statistics,
&lt;em>Robust&lt;/em> statistics,
and many other statistics.
And almost no one discusses &lt;em>Pragmatic&lt;/em> statistics.
I feel like we really need something which is called &lt;em>Pragmatic&lt;/em> statistics.
However, it should not be just a set of &amp;ldquo;blessed&amp;rdquo; approaches but rather a mindset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me make an attempt to speculate on the principles
that should form the foundation of the &lt;em>Pragmatic&lt;/em> statistics approach.
In future posts, I will show how to apply these principles to solve real-world problems.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
