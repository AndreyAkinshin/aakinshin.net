While &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/wmw1/">previously suggested approach&lt;/a> feel promising,
I don&amp;rsquo;t like the usage of Bootstrap to obtain the $p$-value.
It is always better to have a deterministic and exact approach where it&amp;rsquo;s possible.
I still don&amp;rsquo;t know how to solve it in general case,
but it seems that I&amp;rsquo;ve obtained a reasonable solution for some specific cases.
The current version of the approach still has issues and
requires additional correction factors in some cases and additional improvements.
However, it passes my minimal requirements, so it is worth trying to continue developing this idea.
In this post, I share the description of the weighted approach and provide numerical examples.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weighted Mann-Whitney U test, Part 2</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/wmw2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/wmw2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Previously, I &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/wmw1/">suggested&lt;/a> a weighted version of the Mann–Whitney $U$ test.
The distribution of the weighted normalized $U_\circ^\star$ can be obtained via bootstrap.
However, it is always nice if we can come up with an exact solution for the statistic distribution or
at least provide reasonable approximations.
In this post, we start exploring this distribution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weighted Mann-Whitney U test, Part 1</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/wmw1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/wmw1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Previously, I have discussed how to build weighted versions of various statistical methods.
I have already covered weighted versions of
&lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/preprint-wqe/">various quantile estimators&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/whl/">the Hodges-Lehmann location estimator&lt;/a>.
Such methods can be useful in various tasks like the support of weighted mixture distributions or exponential smoothing.
In this post, I suggest a way to build a weighted version of the Mann-Whitney U test.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
