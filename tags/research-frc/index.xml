&lt;p>Abstract:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Rousseeuw-Croux $S_n$, $Q_n$ scale estimators and the median absolute deviation $\operatorname{MAD}_n$
can be used as consistent estimators for the standard deviation under normality.
All of them are highly robust: the breakdown point of all three estimators is $50\%$.
However, $S_n$ and $Q_n$ are much more efficient than $\operatorname{MAD}_n$:
their asymptotic Gaussian efficiency values are $58\%$ and $82\%$ respectively
compared to $37\%$ for $\operatorname{MAD}_n$.
Although these values look impressive, they are only asymptotic values.
The actual Gaussian efficiency of $S_n$ and $Q_n$ for small sample sizes
is noticeably lower than in the asymptotic case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original work by Rousseeuw and Croux (1993)
provides only rough approximations of the finite-sample bias-correction factors for $S_n,\, Q_n$
and brief notes on their finite-sample efficiency values.
In this paper, we perform extensive Monte-Carlo simulations in order to obtain refined values of the
finite-sample properties of the Rousseeuw-Croux scale estimators.
We present accurate values of the bias-correction factors and Gaussian efficiency for small samples ($n \leq 100$)
and prediction equations for samples of larger sizes.&lt;/p>

are &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/rousseeuw-croux-finite-efficiency/">efficient&lt;/a> alternatives to the median absolute deviation ($\operatorname{MAD}_n$).
While all three estimators have the same breakdown point of $50\%$,
$S_n$ and $Q_n$ have higher statistical efficiency than $\operatorname{MAD}_n$.
The asymptotic Gaussian efficiency values of $\operatorname{MAD}_n$, $S_n$, and $Q_n$
are $37\%$, $58\%$, and $82\%$ respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using scale constants, we can make $S_n$ and $Q_n$ consistent estimators for the standard deviation under normality.
The asymptotic values of these constants are well-known.
However, for finite-samples, only approximated scale constants are known.
In this post, we provide refined values of these constants with higher accuracy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Finite-sample efficiency of the Rousseeuw-Croux estimators</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/rousseeuw-croux-finite-efficiency/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/rousseeuw-croux-finite-efficiency/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Rousseeuw-Croux $S_n$ and $Q_n$ estimators are robust and efficient measures of scale.
Their breakdown points are equal to $0.5$ which is also the breakdown point of the median absolute deviation (MAD).
However, their statistical efficiency values are much better than the efficiency of MAD.
To be specific, the MAD asymptotic relative Gaussian efficiency against the standard deviation is about $37\%$,
whereas the corresponding values for $S_n$ and $Q_n$ are $58\%$ and $82\%$ respectively.
Although these numbers are quite impressive, they are only &lt;em>asymptotic&lt;/em> values.
In practice, we work with finite samples.
And the &lt;em>finite-sample efficiency&lt;/em> could be much lower than the asymptotic one.
In this post, we perform a simulation study in order to obtain the actual finite-sample efficiency values
for these two estimators.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
