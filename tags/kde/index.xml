Based on the given sample, it allows estimating the probability density function (PDF) of the underlying distribution.
Here is an example of KDE for &lt;code>x = {3.82, 4.61, 4.89, 4.91, 5.31, 5.6, 5.66, 7.00, 7.00, 7.00}&lt;/code>
(normal kernel, Sheather &amp;amp; Jones bandwidth selector):&lt;/p>

&lt;p>KDE is a simple and straightforward way to build a PDF, but it&amp;rsquo;s not always the best one.
In addition to my &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/kde-bw/">concerns about bandwidth selection&lt;/a>,
continuous use of KDE creates an illusion that all distributions are smooth and continuous.
In practice, it&amp;rsquo;s not always true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the above picture, the distribution looks pretty continuous.
However, the picture hides the fact that we have three &lt;code>7.00&lt;/code> elements in the original sample.
With continuous distributions, the probability of getting tied observations (that have the same value) is almost zero.
If a sample contains ties, we are most likely working with
either a discrete distribution or a mixture of discrete and continuous distributions.
A KDE for such a sample may significantly differ from the actual PDF.
Thus, this technique may mislead us instead of providing insights about the true underlying distribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, we discuss the usage of PDF and PMF with continuous and discrete distributions.
Also, we look at examples of corrupted density estimation plots for distributions with discrete features.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The importance of kernel density estimation bandwidth</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/kde-bw/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/kde-bw/</guid><description>&lt;p>Below see two kernel density estimations.

&lt;p>Most likely, you say that the first plot is based on a uniform distribution,
and the second one is based on a multimodal distribution with four modes.
Although this is not obvious from the plots,
both density plots are based on the same sample:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">21.370, 19.435, 20.363, 20.632, 20.404, 19.893, 21.511, 19.905, 22.018, 19.93,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">31.304, 32.286, 28.611, 29.721, 29.866, 30.635, 29.715, 27.343, 27.559, 31.32,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">39.693, 38.218, 39.828, 41.214, 41.895, 39.569, 39.742, 38.236, 40.460, 39.36,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">50.455, 50.704, 51.035, 49.391, 50.504, 48.282, 49.215, 49.149, 47.585, 50.03
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The only difference between plots is in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation#Bandwidth_selection">bandwidth selection&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bandwidth selection is crucial when you are trying to visualize your distributions.
Unfortunately, most people just call a regular function to build a density plot and don&amp;rsquo;t think about how the bandwidth will be chosen.
As a result, the plot may present data in the wrong way, which may lead to incorrect conclusions.
Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss bandwidth selection in detail and figure out how to improve the correctness of your density plots.
In this post, we will cover the following topics:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Kernel density estimation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How bandwidth selection affects plot smoothness&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Which bandwidth selectors can we use&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Which bandwidth selectors should we use&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Insidious default bandwidth selectors in statistical packages&lt;/li>
