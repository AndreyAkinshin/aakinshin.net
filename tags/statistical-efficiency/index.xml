Their breakdown points are equal to $0.5$ which is also the breakdown point of the median absolute deviation (MAD).
However, their statistical efficiency values are much better than the efficiency of MAD.
To be specific, the MAD asymptotic relative Gaussian efficiency against the standard deviation is about $37\%$,
whereas the corresponding values for $S_n$ and $Q_n$ are $58\%$ and $82\%$ respectively.
Although these numbers are quite impressive, they are only &lt;em>asymptotic&lt;/em> values.
In practice, we work with finite samples.
And the &lt;em>finite-sample efficiency&lt;/em> could be much lower than the asymptotic one.
In this post, we perform a simulation study in order to obtain the actual finite-sample efficiency values
for these two estimators.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Avoiding over-trimming with the trimmed Harrell-Davis quantile estimator</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/thdqe-overtrimming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/thdqe-overtrimming/</guid><description>&lt;p>Previously, I already discussed the
&lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/trimmed-hdqe/">trimmed modification of the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator&lt;/a> several times.
I performed several numerical simulations that compare the statistical efficiency of this estimator
with the efficiency of the &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/wthdqe-efficiency/">classic Harrell-Davis quantile estimator&lt;/a> (HDQE)
and its &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/winsorized-hdqe/">winsorized modification&lt;/a>;
I showed how we can improve the efficiency using &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/customized-wthdqe/">custom trimming strategies&lt;/a>
and how to choose a &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/thdqe-threshold/">good trimming threshold value&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the heavy-tailed cases, the trimmed HDQE provides better estimations than the classic HDQE
because of its higher breakdown point.
However, in the light-tailed cases, we could get efficiency that is worse than
the baseline Hyndman-Fan Type 7 (HF7) quantile estimator.
In many cases, such an effect arises because of the over-trimming effect.
If the trimming percentage is too high or if the evaluated quantile is too far from the median,
the trimming strategy based on the highest-density interval may lead to an estimation
that is based on single order statistics.
In this case, we get an efficiency level similar to the Hyndman-Fan Type 1-3 quantile estimators
(which are also based on single order statistics).
In the light-tailed case, such a result is less preferable than Hyndman-Fan Type 4-9 quantile estimators
(which are based on two subsequent order statistics).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to improve the situation, we could introduce the lower bound for the number of order statistics
that contribute to the final quantile estimations.
In this post, I look at some numerical simulations
that compare trimmed HDQEs with different lower bounds.&lt;/p>

However, the statistical efficiency of these estimators is not so great.
The Harrell-Davis quantile estimator has much better efficiency (at least in the light-tailed case),
but it&amp;rsquo;s not robust (because it calculates a weighted sum of all sample values).
I already wrote a &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/trimmed-hdqe/">post about trimmed Harrell-Davis quantile estimator&lt;/a>:
this approach suggest dropping some of the low-weight sample values to improve robustness
(keeping good statistical efficiency).
I also perform a numerical simulations that &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/wthdqe-efficiency/">compare efficiency&lt;/a>
of the original Harrell-Davis quantile estimator against its trimmed and winsorized modifications.
It&amp;rsquo;s time to discuss how to choose the optimal trimming threshold
and how it affects the estimator efficiency.&lt;/p>

Typically, it&amp;rsquo;s expressed via the mean square error ($\operatorname{MSE}$).
For the given estimator $T$ and the true parameter value $\theta$,
the $\operatorname{MSE}$ can be expressed as follows:&lt;/p>
$$
\operatorname{MSE}(T) = \operatorname{E}[(T-\theta)^2]
$$
&lt;p>In numerical simulations, the $\operatorname{MSE}$ can&amp;rsquo;t be used as a robust metric
because its breakdown point is zero
(a corruption of a single measurement leads to a corrupted result).
Typically, it&amp;rsquo;s not a problem for light-tailed distributions.
Unfortunately, in the heavy-tailed case,
the $\operatorname{MSE}$ becomes an unreliable and unreproducible metric
because it can be easily spoiled by a single outlier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suggest an alternative way to compare statistical estimators.
Instead of using non-robust $\operatorname{MSE}$,
we can use robust quantile estimations of the absolute error distribution.
In this post, I want to share numerical simulations
that show a problem of irreproducible $\operatorname{MSE}$ values
and how they can be replaced by reproducible quantile values.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Improving the efficiency of the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator for special cases using custom winsorizing and trimming strategies</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/customized-wthdqe/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/customized-wthdqe/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s say we want to
&lt;strong>estimate the median&lt;/strong>
based on a &lt;strong>small sample&lt;/strong> (3 $\leq n \leq 7$)
from a &lt;strong>right-skewed heavy-tailed distribution&lt;/strong>
with &lt;strong>high statistical efficiency&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The traditional median estimator is the most robust estimator, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the most efficient one.
Typically, the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator provides better efficiency,
but it&amp;rsquo;s not robust (its breakdown point is zero),
so it may have worse efficiency in the given case.
The &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/winsorized-hdqe/">winsorized&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/trimmed-hdqe/">trimmed&lt;/a>
modifications of the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator provide a good trade-off
between efficiency and robustness, but they require a proper winsorizing/trimming rule.
A reasonable choice of such a rule for medium-size samples is based on the highest density interval of the Beta function
(as described &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/winsorized-hdqe/">here&lt;/a>).
Unfortunately, this approach may be suboptimal for small samples.
E.g., if we use the 99% highest density interval to estimate the median,
it starts to trim sample values only for $n \geq 8$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, we are going to discuss custom winsorizing/trimming strategies for special cases of the quantile estimation problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Comparing the efficiency of the Harrell-Davis, Sfakianakis-Verginis, and Navruz-Özdemir quantile estimators</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/hd-sv-no-efficiency/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/hd-sv-no-efficiency/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the previous posts, I discussed the statistical efficiency of different quantile estimators

its &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_(statistics)">efficiency&lt;/a>.
In simple words, the efficiency describes the estimator accuracy.
The Harrell-Davis quantile estimator is a good option to achieve higher efficiency.
However, this estimator may provide lower efficiency in some special cases.
In this post, we will conduct a set of simulations that show the actual efficiency numbers.
We compare different distributions (symmetric and right-skewed, heavy-tailed and light-tailed),
quantiles, and sample sizes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
