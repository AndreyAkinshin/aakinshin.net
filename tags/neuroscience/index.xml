In practice, this comparison is often based on an incorrect procedure involving two separate tests in which researchers conclude that effects differ when one effect is significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) but the other is not (P &amp;gt; 0.05). We reviewed 513 behavioral, systems and cognitive neuroscience articles in five top-ranking journals (Science, Nature, Nature Neuroscience, Neuron and The Journal of Neuroscience) and found that 78 used the correct procedure and 79 used the incorrect procedure. An additional analysis suggests that incorrect analyses of interactions are even more common in cellular and molecular neuroscience.</description></item><item><title>Power failure: why small sample size undermines the reliability of neuroscience</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/button2013/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/button2013/</guid><description>Reference Katherine S Button, John P A Ioannidis, Claire Mokrysz, Brian A Nosek, Jonathan Flint, Emma S J Robinson, Marcus R Munafò “Power failure: why small sample size undermines the reliability of neuroscience” (2013) // Nature Reviews Neuroscience.

Here, we show that the average statistical power of studies in the neurosciences is very low. The consequences of this include overestimates of effect size and low reproducibility of results. There are also ethical dimensions to this problem, as unreliable research is inefficient and wasteful. Improving reproducibility in neuroscience is a key priority and requires attention to well-established but often ignored methodological principles.</description></item><item><title>The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons: The History of the Human Brain as Revealed by True Stories of Trauma, Madness, and Recovery</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/kean-the-tale-of-the-dueling-neurosurgeons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/kean-the-tale-of-the-dueling-neurosurgeons/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Voodoo Correlations Are Everywhere—Not Only in Neuroscience</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/fiedler2011/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/fiedler2011/</guid><description>Reference Klaus Fiedler “Voodoo Correlations Are Everywhere—Not Only in Neuroscience” (2011) // Perspectives on Psychological Science.
