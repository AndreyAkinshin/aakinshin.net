Unfortunately, if the distribution is not normal (e.g., right-skewed and heavy-tailed), it&amp;rsquo;s hard to choose
a robust outlier detection algorithm that will not be affected by tricky distribution properties.
During the last several years, I tried many different approaches, but I was not satisfied with their results.
Finally, I found an algorithm to which I have (almost) no complaints.
It&amp;rsquo;s based on the &lt;em>double median absolute deviation&lt;/em> and the &lt;em>Harrell-Davis quantile estimator&lt;/em>.
In this post, I will show how it works and why it&amp;rsquo;s better than some other approaches.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
