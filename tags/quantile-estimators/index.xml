the trimmed modification of the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator

This quantile estimator showed a decent level of statistical efficiency.
However, the research wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be complete without comparison with the winsorized modification.
Let&amp;rsquo;s fix it!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quantile estimators based on k order statistics, Part 7: Optimal threshold for the trimmed Harrell-Davis quantile estimator</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe7/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe7/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe6/">previous post&lt;/a>, we have obtained a nice quantile estimator.
To be specific, we considered a trimmed modification of the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator
based on the highest density interval of the given size.
The interval size is a parameter that controls the trade-off between statistical efficiency and robustness.
While it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have the ability to control this trade-off, there is also a need for the default value,
which could be used as a starting point
when we have neither estimator breakdown point requirements nor prior knowledge about distribution properties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a series of unsuccessful attempts, it seems that I have found an acceptable solution.
We should build the new estimator based on $\sqrt{n}/n$ order statistics.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to briefly explain the idea behind the suggested estimator and
share some numerical simulations that compare the proposed estimator
and the classic Harrell-Davis quantile estimator.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quantile estimators based on k order statistics, Part 6: Continuous trimmed Harrell-Davis quantile estimator</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe6/</guid><description>&lt;p>In my &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe5/">previous post&lt;/a>,
I tried the idea of using the trimmed modification of the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator
based on the highest density interval of the given width.
The width was defined so that it covers exactly k order statistics (the width equals $(k-1)/n$).
I was pretty satisfied with the result and decided to continue evolving this approach.
While &amp;ldquo;k order statistics&amp;rdquo; is a good mental model that described the trimmed interval,
it doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually require an integer k.
In fact, we can use any real number as the trimming percentage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, we are going to perform numerical simulations that check the statistical efficiency
of the trimmed Harrell-Davis quantile estimator with different trimming percentages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quantile estimators based on k order statistics, Part 5: Improving trimmed Harrell-Davis quantile estimator</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe5/</guid><description>&lt;p>During the last several months,
I have been experimenting with different variations of the trimmed Harrell-Davis quantile estimator.
&lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/trimmed-hdqe/">My original idea&lt;/a>
of using the highest density interval based on the fixed area percentage (e.g., HDI 95% or HDI 99%)
led to a set of problems with &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/thdqe-overtrimming/">overtrimming&lt;/a>.
I tried to solve them with &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/customized-wthdqe/">manually customized&lt;/a> trimming strategy,
but this approach turned out to be too inconvenient;
it was too hard to come up with &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/thdqe-threshold/">optimal thresholds&lt;/a>.
One of the main problems was about the suboptimal number of elements
that we actually aggregate to obtain the quantile estimation.
So, I decided to try an &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe1/">approach that involves exactly k order statistics&lt;/a>.
The idea was so promising,
but numerical simulations &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe4/">haven&amp;rsquo;t shown&lt;/a> the appropriate efficiency level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This bothered me the whole week.
It sounded so reasonable to trim the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator using exactly k order statistics.
Why didn&amp;rsquo;t this work as expected?
Finally, I have found a fatal flaw in &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe4/">my previous approach&lt;/a>:
while it was a good idea to fix the size of the trimming window,
I mistakenly chose its location following the equation from the Hyndman-Fan Type 7 quantile estimator!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, we fix this problem and try another modification of the trimmed Harrell-Davis quantile estimator based on
k order statistics &lt;strong>and&lt;/strong> highest density intervals at the same time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quantile estimators based on k order statistics, Part 4: Adopting trimmed Harrell-Davis quantile estimator</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe4/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the previous posts, I discussed various aspects of
&lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe1/">quantile estimators based on k order statistics&lt;/a>.
I already tried a few weight functions that aggregate the sample values to the quantile estimators
(see posts about &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe2/">an extension of the Hyndman-Fan Type 7 equation&lt;/a> and
about &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe3/">adjusted regularized incomplete beta function&lt;/a>).
In this post, I continue my experiments and try to adopt the
&lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/trimmed-hdqe/">trimmed modifications of the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator&lt;/a> to this approach.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quantile estimators based on k order statistics, Part 3: Playing with the Beta function</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe3/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the previous two posts, I discussed the idea of quantile estimators based on k order statistics.
A already covered the &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe1/">motivation behind this idea&lt;/a>
and the statistical efficiency of such estimators using the &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe2/">extended Hyndman-Fan equations&lt;/a>
as a weight function.
Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to experiment with the Beta function as a primary way to aggregate k order statistics
into a single quantile estimation!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quantile estimators based on k order statistics, Part 2: Extending Hyndman-Fan equations</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe2/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/kosqe1/">previous post&lt;/a>,
I described the idea of using quantile estimators based on k order statistics.
Potentially, such estimators could be more robust than estimators based on all samples elements (like
Harrell-Davis,
&lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/sfakianakis-verginis-quantile-estimator/">Sfakianakis-Verginis&lt;/a>, or
&lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/navruz-ozdemir-quantile-estimator/">Navruz-Ã–zdemir&lt;/a>)
and more statistically efficient than traditional quantile estimators (based on 1 or 2 order statistics).
Moreover, we should be able to control this trade-off based on the business requirements
(e.g., setting the desired breakdown point).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only challenging thing here is choosing the weight function
that aggregates k order statistics to a single quantile estimation.
We are going to try several options, perform Monte-Carlo simulations for each of them, and compare the results.
A reasonable starting point is an extension of the traditional quantile estimators.
In this post, we are going to extend the Hyndman-Fan Type 7 quantile estimator
(nowadays, it&amp;rsquo;s one of the most popular estimators).
It estimates quantiles as a linear interpolation of two subsequent order statistics.
We are going to make some modifications, so a new version is going to be based on k order statistics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Spoiler: this approach doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like an optimal one.&lt;/strong>
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty disappointed with its statistical efficiency on samples from light-tailed distributions.
So, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of writing a blog post about an inefficient approach?
Because of the following reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I believe it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to share negative results.
Sometimes, knowledge about approaches that don&amp;rsquo;t work
could be more important than knowledge about more effective techniques.
Negative results give you a broader view of the problem
and protect you from wasting your time on potential promising (but not so useful) ideas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Negative results improve research completeness.
When we present an approach, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to not only show why it solves problems well,
but also why it solves problems better than other similar approaches.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend my extension of the Hyndman-Fan Type 7 quantile estimator to the k order statistics case
as the default quantile estimator, there are some specific cases where it could be useful.
For example, if we estimate the median based on small samples from a symmetric light-tailed distribution,
it could outperform not only the original version but also the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator.
The &amp;ldquo;negativity&amp;rdquo; of the negative results always exists in a specific context.
So, there may be cases when negative results for the general case transform to positive results
for a particular niche problem.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s my personal blog, so I have the freedom to write on any topic I like.
My blog posts are not publications to scientific journals (which typically don&amp;rsquo;t welcome negative results),
but rather research notes about conducted experiments.
It&amp;rsquo;s important for me to keep records of all the experiments I perform regardless of the usefulness of the results.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So, let&amp;rsquo;s briefly look at the results of this not-so-useful approach.&lt;/p>

In my previous posts, I considered several groups of quantile estimators:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Quantile estimators based 1 or 2 order statistics (Hyndman-Fan Type1-9)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Quantile estimators based on all order statistics
(the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator,
the &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/sfakianakis-verginis-quantile-estimator/">Sfakianakis-Verginis quantile estimator&lt;/a>, and
the &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/navruz-ozdemir-quantile-estimator/">Navruz-Ã–zdemir quantile estimator&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Quantile estimators based on a variable number of order statistics
(the &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/trimmed-hdqe/">trimmed&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/winsorized-hdqe/">winsorized&lt;/a> modifications
of the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, all of these estimators have significant drawbacks
(e.g., poor statistical efficiency or poor robustness).
In this post, I want to discuss all of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach
and suggest another family of quantile estimators that are based on k order statistics.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
