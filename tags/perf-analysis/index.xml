It&amp;rsquo;s quite convenient to use it to run unit and integration tests.
However, some developers try to use it to run benchmarks and performance tests.
Unfortunately, default GitHub Actions build agents do not provide
a consistent execution environment from the performance point of view.
Therefore, performance measurements from different builds can not be compared.
This makes it almost impossible to set up reliable performance tests based
on the default GitHub Actions build agent pool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, it&amp;rsquo;s expected that the execution environments are not &lt;em>absolutely&lt;/em> identical.
But how bad is the situation?
What&amp;rsquo;s the maximum difference between performance measurements from different builds?
Is there a chance that we can play with thresholds and
utilize GitHub Actions to detect at least major performance degradations?
Let&amp;rsquo;s find out!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
