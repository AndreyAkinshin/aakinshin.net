&lt;p>Abstract:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The median absolute deviation is a widely used robust measure of statistical dispersion.
Using a scale constant, we can use it as an asymptotically consistent estimator for the standard deviation under normality.
For finite samples, the scale constant should be corrected in order to obtain an unbiased estimator.
The bias-correction factor depends on the sample size and the median estimator.
When we use the traditional sample median, the factor values are well known,
but this approach does not provide optimal statistical efficiency.
In this paper, we present the bias-correction factors for the median absolute deviation
based on the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator and its trimmed modification
which allow us to achieve better statistical efficiency of the standard deviation estimations.
The obtained estimators are especially useful for samples with a small number of elements.&lt;/p>

is a robust measure of scale.
For a sample $x = \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \}$, it&amp;rsquo;s defined as follows:&lt;/p>
$$
\operatorname{MAD}_n = C_n \cdot \operatorname{median}(|x - \operatorname{median}(x)|)
$$
&lt;p>where $\operatorname{median}$ is a median estimator, $C_n$ is a scale factor.
Using the right scale factor, we can use $\operatorname{MAD}$ as a consistent estimator
for the estimation of the standard deviation under the normal distribution.
For huge samples, we can use the asymptotic value of $C_n$ which is&lt;/p>
$$
C_\infty = \dfrac{1}{\Phi^{-1}(3/4)} \approx 1.4826022185056.
$$
&lt;p>For small samples, we should use adjusted values $C_n$ which depend on the sample size.
However, $C_n$ depends not only on the sample size but also on the median estimator.
I have already covered how to obtain this values for
&lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/unbiased-mad/">the traditional median estimator&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/unbiased-mad-hd/">the Harrell-Davis median estimator&lt;/a>.
It&amp;rsquo;s time to get the $C_n$ values for

is a robust measure of scale.
In the previous post, I &lt;a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/unbiased-mad/">showed&lt;/a>
how to use the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator">unbiased&lt;/a>
version of the $\textrm{MAD}$ estimator
as a robust alternative to the standard deviation.
&amp;ldquo;Unbiasedness&amp;rdquo; means that such estimator&amp;rsquo;s expected value equals the true value of the standard deviation.
Unfortunately, there is such thing as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff">biasâ€“variance tradeoff&lt;/a>:
when we remove the bias of the $\textrm{MAD}$ estimator,
we increase its variance and mean squared error ($\textrm{MSE}$).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I want to suggest a more &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_(statistics)">efficient&lt;/a>
unbiased $\textrm{MAD}$ estimator.
It&amp;rsquo;s also a consistent estimator for the standard deviation, but it has smaller $\textrm{MSE}$.
To build this estimator,
we should replace the classic &amp;ldquo;straightforward&amp;rdquo; median estimator with the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator
and adjust bias-correction factors.
Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss this approach in detail.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unbiased median absolute deviation</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/unbiased-mad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/posts/unbiased-mad/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation">median absolute deviation&lt;/a> ($\textrm{MAD}$)
is a robust measure of scale.
For distribution $X$, it can be calculated as follows:&lt;/p>
$$
\textrm{MAD} = C \cdot \textrm{median}(|X - \textrm{median}(X)|)
$$
&lt;p>where $C$ is a constant scale factor.
This metric can be used as a robust alternative to the standard deviation.
If we want to use the $\textrm{MAD}$ as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator">consistent estimator&lt;/a>
for the standard deviation under the normal distribution,
we should set&lt;/p>
$$
C = C_{\infty} = \dfrac{1}{\Phi^{-1}(3/4)} \approx 1.4826022185056.
$$
&lt;p>where $\Phi^{-1}$ is the quantile function of the standard normal distribution
(or the inverse of the cumulative distribution function).
If $X$ is the normal distribution, we get $\textrm{MAD} = \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s consider a sample $x = \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n \}$.
Let&amp;rsquo;s denote the median absolute deviation for a sample of size $n$ as $\textrm{MAD}_n$.
The corresponding equation looks similar to the definition of $\textrm{MAD}$ for a distribution:&lt;/p>
$$
\textrm{MAD}_n = C_n \cdot \textrm{median}(|x - \textrm{median}(x)|).
$$
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that $\textrm{median}$ is the straightforward definition of the median
(if $n$ is odd, the median is the middle element of the sorted sample,
if $n$ is even, the median is the arithmetic average of the two middle elements of the sorted sample).
We still can use $C_n = C_{\infty}$ for extremely large sample sizes.
However, for small $n$, $\textrm{MAD}_n$ becomes a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator">biased estimator&lt;/a>.
If we want to get an unbiased version, we should adjust the value of $C_n$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, we look at the possible approaches and learn the way to get the exact value of $C_n$
that makes $\textrm{MAD}_n$ unbiased estimator of the median absolute deviation for any $n$.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
