Probably, you saw plots of the normal distribution density function in some statistics textbooks,
it looks like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The normal distribution is a pretty user-friendly mental model when we are trying to interpret the statistical metrics
like mean and standard deviation.
However, it may also be an insidious and misleading model when your distribution is not normal.
There is a great sentence in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/34.3-4.209">&amp;ldquo;Testing for normality&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> paper by R.C. Geary, 1947 (the quote was found &lt;a href="https://garstats.wordpress.com/2019/06/17/myth/">here&lt;/a>):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Normality is a myth; there never was, and never will be, a normal distribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I 100% agree with this statement.
At least, if you are working with performance distributions
(that are based on the multiple iterations of your benchmarks that measure the performance metrics of your applications),
you should forget about normality.
That&amp;rsquo;s how a typical performance distribution looks like
(I built the below picture based on a real benchmark that measures the load time of assemblies
when we open the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard">Orchard&lt;/a> solution in &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Rider&lt;/a> on Linux):&lt;/p>

To answer this question it is desirable to have regard to the logical position of the statistician, concerned with drawing inferences from samples whose characteristic approach may be defined as reductio ad paene absurdum: if an event is highly improbable it must be regarded for practical purposes as impossible.</description></item><item><title>Distributions Are Never Normal</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/quotes/8c71defc-488a-4b1e-a360-f0b37f77de12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/quotes/8c71defc-488a-4b1e-a360-f0b37f77de12/</guid><description>To begin, distributions are never normal. For some this seems obvious, hardly worth mentioning, but an aphorism given by Cramér (1946) and attributed to the mathematician Poincaré remains relevant: “Everyone believes in the [normal] law of errors, the experimenters because they think it is a mathematical theorem, the mathematicians because they think it is an experimental fact.”</description></item><item><title>Natural Population is Ever Exactly Normal</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/quotes/8c0aba63-5274-4e0c-9ff5-a564a8765962/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/quotes/8c0aba63-5274-4e0c-9ff5-a564a8765962/</guid><description>For example, we may formulate the hypothesis that a population is normally distributed, but we realize that no natural population is ever exactly normal.
