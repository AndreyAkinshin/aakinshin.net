Probably, you saw plots of the normal distribution density function in some statistics textbooks,
it looks like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The normal distribution is a pretty user-friendly mental model when we are trying to interpret the statistical metrics
like mean and standard deviation.
However, it may also be an insidious and misleading model when your distribution is not normal.
There is a great sentence in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/34.3-4.209">&amp;ldquo;Testing for normality&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> paper by R.C. Geary, 1947 (the quote was found &lt;a href="https://garstats.wordpress.com/2019/06/17/myth/">here&lt;/a>):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Normality is a myth; there never was, and never will be, a normal distribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I 100% agree with this statement.
At least, if you are working with performance distributions
(that are based on the multiple iterations of your benchmarks that measure the performance metrics of your applications),
you should forget about normality.
That&amp;rsquo;s how a typical performance distribution looks like
(I built the below picture based on a real benchmark that measures the load time of assemblies
when we open the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard">Orchard&lt;/a> solution in &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Rider&lt;/a> on Linux):&lt;/p>

For some this seems obvious, hardly worth mentioning, but an aphorism given by Cramér (1946) and attributed to the mathematician Poincaré remains relevant: “Everyone believes in the [normal] law of errors, the experimenters because they think it is a mathematical theorem, the mathematicians because they think it is an experimental fact.”</description></item><item><title>Normal subjects</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/quotes/ca964333-044c-4fec-8d89-145921696525/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/quotes/ca964333-044c-4fec-8d89-145921696525/</guid><description>Normal or approximately normal subjects are less useful objects of research than their pathological counterparts.</description></item></channel></rss>
