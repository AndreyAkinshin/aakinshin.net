Abstract We briefly summarize some of the lessons learned in a workshop on cognitive studies of science and technology. Our purpose was to assemble a diverse group of practitioners to discuss the latest research, identify the stumbling blocks to advancement in this field, and brainstorm about directions for the future. Two questions became central themes. First, how can we combine artificial studies involving ‘spherical horses’ with fine-grained case studies of actual practice? Results obtained in the laboratory may have low applicability to real world situations. Second, how can we deal with academics’ attachments to their theoretical frameworks? Academics often like to develop unique ‘toothbrushes‘ and are reluctant to use anyone else’s. The workshop illustrated that toothbrushes can be shared and that spherical horses and fine-grained case studies can complement one another. Theories need to deal rigorously with the distributed character of scientific and technological problem solving. We hope this workshop will suggest directions more sophisticated theories might take.

In one study, he videotaped two astronomers interacting over a new set of data concerning the formation of ring galaxies. Schunn found that these researchers noticed anomalies as much as expected results, but paid more attention to the anomalies. The researchers developed hypotheses about the anomalies and elaborated on them visually, whereas they used theory to elaborate on expected results. When the two astronomers discussed the anomalies, they used terms like ‘the funky thing’ and ‘the dipsy-doodle’, staying at a perceptual rather than a theoretical level. Schunn’s astronomers were working neither in the hypothesis nor experimental space; instead, they were working in a space of possible visualizations dependent on their domain-specific experience.</description></item><item><title>The Doors of Perception</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/huxley-the-doors-of-perception/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/huxley-the-doors-of-perception/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/mlodinow-the-drunkards-walk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/mlodinow-the-drunkards-walk/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Fourfold Remedy: Epicurus and the Art of Happiness</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/sellars-the-fourfold-remedy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/sellars-the-fourfold-remedy/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The God Delusion</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/dawkins-the-god-delusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/dawkins-the-god-delusion/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Logic of Scientific Discovery</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/popper-the-logic-of-scientific-discovery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/popper-the-logic-of-scientific-discovery/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Miracle of Mindfulness: An Introduction to the Practice of Meditation</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/hanh-the-miracle-of-mindfulness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/hanh-the-miracle-of-mindfulness/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Obstacle is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials Into Triumph</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/holiday-the-obstacle-is-the-way/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/holiday-the-obstacle-is-the-way/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Republic</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/plato-the-republic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/plato-the-republic/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Selfish Gene</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/dawkins-the-selfish-gene/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/dawkins-the-selfish-gene/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/kuhn-the-structure-of-scientific-revolutions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/kuhn-the-structure-of-scientific-revolutions/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/manson-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fck/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/manson-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fck/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Tao of Pooh</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/hoff-the-tao-of-pooh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/hoff-the-tao-of-pooh/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Te of Piglet</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/hoff-the-te-of-piglet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/hoff-the-te-of-piglet/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Toothbrush Problem</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/quotes/3e2e8840-784d-41ed-8c01-5a880bd614c2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/quotes/3e2e8840-784d-41ed-8c01-5a880bd614c2/</guid><description>Taxonomies and frameworks are like toothbrushes — no one wants to use anyone else’s.
The attribution of this quotation is ambiguous. A nice historical overview of the quote can be found in A useless history of the “Frameworks are Like Toothbrushes” quote. While gorman2001 is one of the first appearances of the quote, this metaphor was especially popularized in The Toothbrush Problem by Walter Mischel. Occasionally, it is used in other works (e.g., see elson2023).</description></item><item><title>The Unfettered Mind: Writings of the Zen Master to the Sword Master</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/soho-the-unfettered-mind/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/soho-the-unfettered-mind/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Way of Zen</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/watts-the-way-of-zen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/watts-the-way-of-zen/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Understanding Human Nature</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/adler-understanding-human-nature/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/adler-understanding-human-nature/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Understanding Life</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/adler-understanding-life/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/adler-understanding-life/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Utopia</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/more-utopia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/more-utopia/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wabi-Sabi: For Artists, Designers, Poets &amp; Philosophers</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/koren-wabi-sabi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/koren-wabi-sabi/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Walden</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/thoreau-walden/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/thoreau-walden/</guid><description/></item><item><title>When Einstein Walked with Gödel: Excursions to the Edge of Thought</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/holt-when-einstein-walked-with-godel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/holt-when-einstein-walked-with-godel/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/pirsig-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/pirsig-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Zen in the Art of Archery</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/herrigel-zen-in-the-art-of-archery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/herrigel-zen-in-the-art-of-archery/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/suzuki-zen-mind-beginners-mind/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/books/suzuki-zen-mind-beginners-mind/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
