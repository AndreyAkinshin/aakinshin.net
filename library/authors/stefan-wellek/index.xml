Essentially, these regulations provide that the positive result of a test, which enables one to demonstrate with the data obtained from a so-called comparative bioavailability trial the equivalence of the new generic version of a drug to the primary manufacturer’s formulation, shall be accepted as a sufficient condition for approval of the generic formulation to the market. The overwhelming practi- cal importance of the entailed problems of bioequivalence assessment (drugs whose equivalence with respect to the measured bioavailabilities can be taken for granted, are termed “bioequivalent” in clinical pharmacology literature), arises mainly out of quantity: Nowadays, at least half of the prescription drug units sold in the leading industrial countries are generic drugs that have been approved to be marketed on the basis of some bioequivalence trial.</description></item><item><title>Testing Statistical Hypotheses of Equivalence and Noninferiority</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/wellek2010/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/wellek2010/</guid><description>Reference Stefan Wellek “Testing Statistical Hypotheses of Equivalence and Noninferiority” (2010) // Publisher: Chapman and Hall/CRC.

However, it is an indispensable step without which the testing problem the experimenter proposes would make no statistical sense at all.</description></item></channel></rss>
