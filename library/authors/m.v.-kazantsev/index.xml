Abstract Existence and location of periodical trajectories are important properties of multi-dimensional dynamical systems. In particular, this relates to systems that model gene networks. We can reduce the areas where cyclic trajectories may be located due to analysis of some discrete structures describing the dynamical system, such as state transition diagrams
