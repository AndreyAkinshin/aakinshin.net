But we may look at the purpose of tests from another view-point. Without hoping to know whether each separate hypothesis is true or false, we may search for rules to govern our behaviour with regard to them, in following which we insure that, in the long run of experience, we shall not be too often wrong.</description></item><item><title>On the problem of the most efficient tests of statistical hypotheses</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/neyman1933/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/neyman1933/</guid><description>Reference Jerzy Neyman, Egon Sharpe Pearson “On the problem of the most efficient tests of statistical hypotheses” (1933) // Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.
