Abstract Three historical episodes in which the application of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) led to the mis-interpretation of data are described. It is argued that the pervasive use of this statistical ritual impedes the accumulation of knowledge and is unfit for use.

These can all be avoided by not testing statistical hypotheses when the research question is about the effect of some treatment; by returning to common sense and the mainstream of science and providing estimates of effect magnitude and its standard error instead.</description></item></channel></rss>
