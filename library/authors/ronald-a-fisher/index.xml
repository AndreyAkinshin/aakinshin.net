Abstract Several reasons have contributed to the prolonged neglect into which the study of statistics, in its theoretical aspects, has fallen. In spite of the immense amount of fruitful labour which has been expended in its practical applications, the basic principles of this organ of science are still in a state of obscurity, and it cannot be denied that, during the recent rapid development of practical methods, fundamental problems have been ignored and fundamental paradoxes left unresolved. This anomalous state of statistical science is strikingly exemplified by a recent paper entitled &amp;ldquo;The Fundamental Problem of Practical Statistics,&amp;rdquo; in which one of the most eminent of modern statisticians presents what purports to be a general proof of BAYES&amp;rsquo; postulate, a proof which, in the opinion of a second statistician of equal eminence, &amp;ldquo;seems to rest upon a very peculiar &amp;ndash; not to say hardly supposable &amp;ndash; relation.&amp;rdquo;

Abstract An explicit statement of the logical nature of statistical reasoning that has been implicitly required in the development and use of statistical techniques in the making of uncertain inferences and in the design of experiments. Included is a consideration of the concept of mathematical probability; a comparison of fiducial and confidence intervals; a comparison of the logic of tests of significance with the acceptance decision approach; and a discussion of the principles of prediction and estimation.
