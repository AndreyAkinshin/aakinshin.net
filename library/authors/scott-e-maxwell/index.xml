The primary argument against this practice has been that it underestimates the strength of relationships and reduces statistical power. Although this argument is correct for relationships involving a single predictor, a different problem can arise when multiple predictors are involved. Specifically, dichotomizing 2 continuous independent variables can lead to false statistical significance. As a result, the typical justification for using a median split as long as results continue to be statistically significant is invalid, because such results may in fact be spurious. Thus, researchers who dichotomize multiple continuous predictor variables not only may lose power to detect true predictor-criterion relationships in some situations but also may dramatically increase the probability of Type I errors in other situations.</description></item><item><title>Rules of Smaple Size Planning</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/quotes/63edb163-442a-4336-a5c4-fc51eb0e94e7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/quotes/63edb163-442a-4336-a5c4-fc51eb0e94e7/</guid><description> Sample size planning is important to enhance cumulative knowledge in the discipline as well as for the individual researcher. Sample size planning can be based on a goal of achieving adequate statistical power, or accurate parameter estimates, or both. Researchers are actively involved in developing methods for sample size planning, especially for complex designs and analyses. Sample sizes necessary to achieve accurate parameter estimates will often be larger than sample sizes necessary to detect even a small effect. Sample sizes necessary to obtain accurate parameter estimates or power to detect small effects may often require resources prohibitive to the individual researcher, thus suggesting the desirability of study registries accompanied by meta-analytic methods.</description></item><item><title>Sample Size Planning for Statistical Power and Accuracy in Parameter Estimation</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/maxwell2008/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/maxwell2008/</guid><description>Reference Scott E Maxwell, Ken Kelley, Joseph R Rausch “Sample Size Planning for Statistical Power and Accuracy in Parameter Estimation” (2008) // Annual Review of Psychology.
