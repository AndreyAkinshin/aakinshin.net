Of these three, two appeared to have pseudoreplication. Of the fourteen papers that used inferential statistics but did not provide sufficient information, five (36%) were suspected of having pseudoreplication, but it was not possible to determine for certain.</description></item><item><title>The Problem of Pseudoreplication in Neuroscientific studies: Is It Affecting Your analysis?</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/lazic2010/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/lazic2010/</guid><description>Reference Stanley E Lazic “The problem of pseudoreplication in neuroscientific studies: is it affecting your analysis?” (2010) // BMC Neuroscience.
