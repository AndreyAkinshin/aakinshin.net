Not that it transmits more bits per second, but rather that it will transmit a greater variety of messages on unexpected topics easily and rapidly. There really seems to be no substitute for &amp;ldquo;looking at the data.&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>The Philosophy of Multiple Comparisons</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/tukey1991/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/tukey1991/</guid><description>Reference John W Tukey “The Philosophy of Multiple Comparisons” (1991) // Statistical Science.

They asked &amp;ldquo;Are the effects of A and B different?&amp;rdquo; and they were willing to answer &amp;ldquo;no.&amp;rdquo;
All we know about the world teaches us that the effects of A and B are always difference — in some decimal place — for any A and B. Thus asking &amp;ldquo;Are the effects different?&amp;rdquo; is foolish.
What we should be answering first is &amp;ldquo;Can we tell the direction in which the effects of A differ from the effects of B?&amp;rdquo; In other words, can we be confident about the direction from A to B? Is it &amp;ldquo;up,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;down&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;uncertain&amp;rdquo;?
The third answer to this first question is that we are &amp;ldquo;uncertain about the direction&amp;rdquo; — it is not, and never should be, that we &amp;ldquo;accept the null hypothesis.&amp;rdquo;</description></item></channel></rss>
