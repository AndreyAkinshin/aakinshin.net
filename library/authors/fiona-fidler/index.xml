Authors of journal articles in psychology, behavioral neuroscience, and medicine were invited to visit a Web site where they adjusted a figure until they judged 2 means, with error bars, to be just statistically significantly different (p &amp;lt; .05). Results from 473 respondents suggest that many leading researchers have severe misconceptions about how error bars relate to statistical significance, do not adequately distinguish CIs and SE bars, and do not appreciate the importance of whether the 2 means are independent or come from a repeated measures design. Better guidelines for researchers and less ambiguous graphical conventions are needed before the advantages of CIs for research communication can be realized.</description></item><item><title>Researchers Misunderstand Confidence Intervals and Standard Error Bars</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/belia2005/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/belia2005/</guid><description>Reference Sarah Belia, Fiona Fidler, Jennifer Williams, Geoff Cumming “Researchers Misunderstand Confidence Intervals and Standard Error Bars” (2005) // Psychological Methods.

I ask that you delete p values as well as comments about statistical significance. If you do not agree with my standards (concerning the inappropriateness of significance tests), you should feel free to argue the point, or simply ignore what you may consider to be my misguided view, by publishing elsewher.</description></item></channel></rss>
