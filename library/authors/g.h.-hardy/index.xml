Hardy expresses his views on mathematics, aesthetics, and life in general mixed with his autobiography notes. He wrote this essay at age 62, and sometimes it feels like &amp;ldquo;an old man yells at cloud,&amp;rdquo; while it is still quite interesting to read. This write-up also fragmentally covers stories of Hardy&amp;rsquo;s close friends including Ramanujan and Littlewood.</description></item></channel></rss>
