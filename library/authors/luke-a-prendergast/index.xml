Abstract The median absolute deviation (MAD) is a robust measure of scale that is simple to implement and easy to interpret. Motivated by this, we introduce interval estimators of the MAD to make reliable inferences for dispersion for a single population and ratios and differences of MADs for comparing two populations. Our simulation results show that the coverage probabilities of the intervals are very close to the nominal coverage for a variety of distributions. We have used partial influence functions to investigate the robustness properties of the difference and ratios of independent MADs.

Abstract The coefficient of variation (CV) is commonly used to measure relative dispersion. However, since it is based on the sample mean and standard deviation, outliers can adversely affect the CV. Additionally, for skewed distributions the mean and standard deviation do not have natural interpretations and, consequently, neither does the CV. Here we investigate the extent to which quantile-based measures of relative dispersion can provide appropriate summary information as an alternative to the CV. In particular, we investigate two measures, the first being the interquartile range (in lieu of the standard deviation), divided by the median (in lieu of the mean), and the second being the median absolute deviation (MAD), divided by the median, as robust estimators of relative dispersion. In addition to comparing the influence functions of the competing estimators and their asymptotic biases and variances, we compare interval estimators using simulation studies to assess coverage.
