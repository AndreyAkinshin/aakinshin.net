This is the so called “look elsewhere effect”. The effect can be quantified in terms of a trial factor, which is the ratio between the probability of observing the excess at some fixed mass point, to the probability of observing it anywhere in the range.</description></item><item><title>Trial factors for the look elsewhere effect in high energy physics</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/gross2010/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/gross2010/</guid><description>Reference Eilam Gross, Ofer Vitells “Trial factors for the look elsewhere effect in high energy physics” (2010) // The European Physical Journal C.
