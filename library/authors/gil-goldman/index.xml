Abstract We consider a signal reconstruction problem for signals $F$ of the form $ F(x)=\backslashsum_\j=1\^\d\a_\j\backslashdelta\backslashleft(x-x_\j\backslashright),$ from their moments $m_k(F)=\backslashint x^kF(x)dx.$ We assume $m_k(F)$ to be known for $k=0,1,\backslashldots,N,$ with an absolute error not exceeding $\backslashepsilon \textgreater 0$. We study the &amp;ldquo;geometry of error amplification&amp;rdquo; in reconstruction of $F$ from $m_k(F),$ in situations where two neighboring nodes $x_i$ and $x_\i+1\$ near-collide, i.e $x_\i+1-x_i=h \backslashll 1$. We show that the error amplification is governed by certain algebraic curves $S_\F,i,$ in the parameter space of signals $F$, along which the first three moments $m_0,m_1,m_2$ remain constant.

Abstract We consider a reconstruction problem for “spike-train” sig nals F of the a priori known form F ( x ) = ∑ d j =1 a j $\delta$ ( x − x j ) , from their moments m k ( F ) = ∫ x k F ( x ) dx. We assume m k ( F ) to be known for k = 0 , 1 , . . . , 2 d − 1 , with an absolute error not exceeding ǫ \textgreater 0. This problem is essentially equivalent to solving the Prony system ∑ d j =1 a j x k j = m k ( F ) , k = 0 , 1 , . . . , 2 d − 1 . We study the “geometry of error amplification” in reconstruc tion of F from m k ( F ) , in situations where the nodes x 1 , . . . , x d near-collide, i.e. form a cluster of size h ≪ 1. We show that in this case error amplification is governed by the “Prony leaves” S q F, in the parameter space of signals F , along which the first q + 1 moments remain constant. On this base we produce accurate , up to the constants, lower and upper bounds on the worst case r econstruction error, and show how the Prony leaves can help in improving rec onstruction accuracy.
