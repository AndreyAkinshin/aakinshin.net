Elsevier. Vol. 45. No 3. Pp. 135–140. DOI: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2008.04.003
Abstract The P value is a measure of statistical evidence that appears in virtually all medical research papers. Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value&amp;rsquo;s inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes&amp;rsquo; factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.

Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC. Vol. 92. No 1. Pp. 57–69. DOI: 10.1007/s10182-008-0057-2
Abstract We propose a parametric test for bimodality based on the likelihood principle by using two-component mixtures. The test uses explicit characterizations of the modal structure of such mixtures in terms of their parameters. Examples include the univariate and multivariate normal distributions and the von Mises distribution. We present the asymptotic distribution of the proposed test and analyze its finite sample performance in a simulation study. To illustrate our method, we use mixtures to investigate the modal structure of the cross-sectional distribution of per capita log GDP across EU regions from 1977 to 1993. Although these mixtures clearly have two components over the whole time period, the resulting distributions evolve from bimodality toward unimodality at the end of the 1970s.

Abstract A new distribution-free estimator Qp of the pth population quantile is formulated, where Qp is a linear combination of order statistics admitting a jackknife variance estimator having excellent properties. The small sample efficiency of Qp is studied under a variety of light and heavy-tailed symmetric and asymmetric distributions. For the distributions and values of p studied, Qp is generally substantially more efficient than the traditional estimator based on one or two order statistics.

As it is widely used in statistical applications, the question is investigated what it is estimating if the shift model does not hold. It is shown that for data whose distributions are symmetric about their median the Hodges–Lehmann estimator based on the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test estimates the difference between the medians of the distributions. This result does generally not hold if the symmetry assumption is violated.

Abstract A simple general approach to inference about the tail behavior of a distribution is proposed. It is not required to assume any global form for the distribution function, but merely the form of behavior in the tail where it is desired to draw inference. Results are particularly simple for distributions of the Zipf type, i.e., where G(y)=1−Cy−αG(y)=1−Cy−αG(y) = 1 - Cy\textasciicircum-\textbackslashalpha\ for large yyy. The methods of inference are based upon an evaluation of the conditional likelihood for the parameters describing the tail behavior, given the values of the extreme order statistics, and can be implemented from both Bayesian and frequentist viewpoints.

Abstract The classical Hill estimator of a positive extreme value index (EVI) can be regarded as the logarithm of the geometric mean, or equivalently the logarithm of the mean of order p=0, of a set of adequate statistics. A simple generalisation of the Hill estimator is now proposed, considering a more general mean of order p≥0 of the same statistics. Apart from the derivation of the asymptotic behaviour of this new class of EVI-estimators, an asymptotic comparison, at optimal levels, of the members of such class and other known EVI-estimators is undertaken. An algorithm for an adaptive estimation of the tuning parameters under play is also provided. A large-scale simulation study and an application to simulated and real data are developed.

Abstract In many statistical applications that concern mathematical psychologists, the concept of Fisher information plays an important role. In this tutorial we clarify the concept of Fisher information as it manifests itself across three different statistical paradigms. First, in the frequentist paradigm, Fisher information is used to construct hypothesis tests and confidence intervals using maximum likelihood estimators; second, in the Bayesian paradigm, Fisher information is used to define a default prior; lastly, in the minimum description length paradigm, Fisher information is used to measure model complexity.

Abstract We consider a signal reconstruction problem for signals $F$ of the form $ F(x)=\backslashsum_\j=1\^\d\a_\j\backslashdelta\backslashleft(x-x_\j\backslashright),$ from their moments $m_k(F)=\backslashint x^kF(x)dx.$ We assume $m_k(F)$ to be known for $k=0,1,\backslashldots,N,$ with an absolute error not exceeding $\backslashepsilon \textgreater 0$. We study the &amp;ldquo;geometry of error amplification&amp;rdquo; in reconstruction of $F$ from $m_k(F),$ in situations where two neighboring nodes $x_i$ and $x_\i+1\$ near-collide, i.e $x_\i+1-x_i=h \backslashll 1$. We show that the error amplification is governed by certain algebraic curves $S_\F,i,$ in the parameter space of signals $F$, along which the first three moments $m_0,m_1,m_2$ remain constant.

Abstract We consider Fourier reconstruction problem for signals F, which are linear combinations of shifted delta-functions. We assume the Fourier transform of F to be known on the frequency interval [-N,N], with an absolute error not exceeding e \textgreater 0. We give an absolute lower bound (which is valid with any reconstruction method) for the &amp;ldquo;worst case&amp;rdquo; reconstruction error of F in situations where the nodes (i.e. the positions of the shifted delta-functions in F) are known to form an l elements cluster of a size h \textless\textless 1. Using &amp;ldquo;decimation&amp;rdquo; reconstruction algorithm we provide an upper bound for the reconstruction error, essentially of the same form as the lower one. Roughly, our main result states that for N*h of order of (2l-1)-st root of e the worst case reconstruction error of the cluster nodes is of the same order as h, and hence the inside configuration of the cluster nodes (in the worst case scenario) cannot be reconstructed at all. On the other hand, decimation algorithm reconstructs F with the accuracy of order of 2l-st root of e.

Abstract In robust estimation one frequently needs an initial or auxiliary estimate of scale. For this one usually takes the median absolute deviation MAD n = 1.4826 med, \textbarxi − med j x j \textbar, because it has a simple explicit formula, needs little computation time, and is very robust as witnessed by its bounded influence function and its 50% breakdown point. But there is still room for improvement in two areas: the fact that MAD n is aimed at symmetric distributions and its low (37%) Gaussian efficiency. In this article we set out to construct explicit and 50% breakdown scale estimators that are more efficient. We consider the estimator Sn = 1.1926 med, med j \textbar xi − xj \textbar and the estimator Qn given by the .25 quantile of the distances \textbarxi − x j \textbar; i \textless j. Note that Sn and Qn do not need any location estimate. Both Sn and Qn can be computed using O(n log n) time and O(n) storage. The Gaussian efficiency of Sn is 58%, whereas Qn attains 82%. We study Sn and Qn by means of their influence functions, their bias curves (for implosion as well as explosion), and their finite-sample performance. Their behavior is also compared at non-Gaussian models, including the negative exponential model where Sn has a lower gross-error sensitivity than the MAD.

Abstract Jittering estimators are nonparametric function estimators for mixed data. They extend arbitrary estimators from the continuous setting by adding random noise to discrete variables. We give an in-depth analysis of the jittering kernel density estimator, which reveals several appealing properties. The estimator is strongly consistent, asymptotically normal, and unbiased for discrete variables. It converges at minimax-optimal rates, which are established as a by-product of our analysis. To understand the effect of adding noise, we further study its asymptotic efficiency and finite sample bias in the univariate discrete case. Simulations show that the estimator is competitive on finite samples. The analysis suggests that similar properties can be expected for other jittering estimators.

Abstract The median absolute deviation (MAD) is a robust measure of scale that is simple to implement and easy to interpret. Motivated by this, we introduce interval estimators of the MAD to make reliable inferences for dispersion for a single population and ratios and differences of MADs for comparing two populations. Our simulation results show that the coverage probabilities of the intervals are very close to the nominal coverage for a variety of distributions.

Abstract Estimating high quantiles plays an important role in the context of risk management. This involves extrapolation of an unknown distribution function. In this paper we propose three methods, namely, the normal approximation method, the likelihood ratio method and the data tilting method, to construct confidence regions for high quantiles of a heavy tailed distribution.

Abstract A common problem when analysing clinical data is that of confounding.

An extreme example of this is Simpson&amp;rsquo;s paradox, in which this third factor reverses the effect first observed.1 This phenomenon has long been recognised as a theoretical possibility but few real examples have been presented.

General Discussion The present research examined a phenomenon known to psychology for almost a century: The persistence in the mind of unfulfilled tasks and goals. Our findings suggest the pattern has not been fully understood. Quite reasonably, the standard assumption has been that incomplete goals remain active in the mind until they are fulfilled, but the present studies showed that goal activation can cease much sooner. Once a specific plan for a goal is made, goal-related cognitive activity is drastically reduced.

Abstract Unfulfilled goals persist in the mind, as asserted by ample theory and evidence (e.g., the Zeigarnik effect).

Abstract We discuss statistical techniques for detecting and quantifying bimodality in astronomical datasets. We concentrate on the KMM algorithm, which estimates the statistical significance of bimodality in such datasets and objectively partitions data into sub-populations. By simulating bimodal distributions with a range of properties we investigate the sensitivity of KMM to datasets with varying characteristics. Our results facilitate the planning of optimal observing strategies for systems where bimodality is suspected. Mixture-modeling algorithms similar to the KMM algorithm have been used in previous studies to partition the stellar population of the Milky Way into subsystems. We illustrate the broad applicability of KMM by analysing published data on globular cluster metallicity distributions, velocity distributions of galaxies in clusters, and burst durations of gamma-ray sources. PostScript versions of the tables and figures, as well as FORTRAN code for KMM and instructions for its use, are available by anonymous ftp from kula.phsx.ukans.edu.

The claim has been made using observational research without accounting for multiple confounding factors. Correlation does not imply causation.
In d101056nejmoa1205409_2013 (double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial), a similar study shows that there is no effect.

Abstract Breast cancer patients with the same stage of disease can have markedly different treatment responses and overall outcome. The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70-80% of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used DNA microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases (&amp;lsquo;poor prognosis&amp;rsquo; signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of BRCA1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome.</description></item><item><title>Genesis of Bimodal Distributions</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/eisenberger1964/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/eisenberger1964/</guid><description>Reference Isidore Eisenberger “Genesis of Bimodal Distributions” (1964) // Technometrics.

Abstract In this paper we approach the analysis of statistics algorithms from a geometric viewpoint and use techniques from computational geometry to develop new, fast algorithms for computing familiar statistical quantities.

Abstract We consider a reconstruction problem for “spike-train” sig nals F of the a priori known form F ( x ) = ∑ d j =1 a j $\delta$ ( x − x j ) , from their moments m k ( F ) = ∫ x k F ( x ) dx. We assume m k ( F ) to be known for k = 0 , 1 , . . . , 2 d − 1 , with an absolute error not exceeding ǫ \textgreater 0. This problem is essentially equivalent to solving the Prony system ∑ d j =1 a j x k j = m k ( F ) , k = 0 , 1 , . . . , 2 d − 1 . We study the “geometry of error amplification” in reconstruc tion of F from m k ( F ) , in situations where the nodes x 1 , . . . , x d near-collide, i.e. form a cluster of size h ≪ 1. We show that in this case error amplification is governed by the “Prony leaves” S q F, in the parameter space of signals F , along which the first q + 1 moments remain constant. On this base we produce accurate , up to the constants, lower and upper bounds on the worst case r econstruction error, and show how the Prony leaves can help in improving rec onstruction accuracy.

Abstract In this paper, we review how researchers can look at very similar data yet have completely different conclusions based purely on an over-reliance of statistical significance and an unclear understanding of confidence intervals. The dogmatic adherence to statistical significant thresholds can lead authors to write dichotomized absolute conclusions while ignoring the broader interpretations of very consistent findings. We describe three examples of controversy around the potential benefit of a medication, a comparison between new medications, and a medication with a potential harm. The examples include the highest levels of evidence, both meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials. We will show how in each case the confidence intervals and point estimates were very similar. The only identifiable differences to account for the contrasting conclusions arise from the serendipitous finding of confidence intervals that either marginally cross or just fail to cross the line of statistical significance.

Publisher: ACM. DOI: 10.1145/3578244.3583719
Abstract Change point detection has recently gained popularity as a method of detecting performance changes in software due to its ability to cope with noisy data. In this paper we present Hunter, an open source tool that automatically detects performance regressions and improvements in time-series data. Hunter uses a modified E-divisive means algorithm to identify statistically significant changes in normally-distributed performance metrics. We describe the changes we made to the E-divisive means algorithm along with their motivation. The main change we adopted was to replace the significance test using randomized permutations with a Student&amp;rsquo;s t-test, as we discovered that the randomized approach did not produce deterministic results, at least not with a reasonable number of iterations. In addition we&amp;rsquo;ve made tweaks that allow us to find change points the original algorithm would not, such as two nearby changes. For evaluation, we developed a method to generate real timeseries, but with artificially injected changes in latency. We used these data sets to compare Hunter against two other well known algorithms, PELT and DYNP. Finally, we conclude with lessons we&amp;rsquo;ve learned supporting Hunter across teams with individual responsibility for the performance of their project.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Multiple Comparisons in Randomized Clinical Trials</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/smith1987/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/smith1987/</guid><description>Reference David Gary Smith, John Clemens, William Crede, Mary Harvey, Edward J Gracely “Impact of multiple comparisons in randomized clinical trials” (1987) // The American Journal of Medicine.

Abstract The combined distribution of heights of men and women has become the canonical illustration of bimodality when teaching introductory statistics. But is this example appropriate? This article investigates the conditions under which a mixture of two normal distributions is bimodal. A simple justification is presented that a mixture of equally weighted normal distributions with common standard deviation σ is bimodal if and only if the difference between the means of the distributions is greater than 2σ. More generally, a mixture of two normal distributions with similar variability cannot be bimodal unless their means differ by more than approximately the sum oftheirstandard deviations. Examination of national survey data on young adults shows that the separation between the distributions of men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s heights is not wide enough to produce bimodality. We suggest reasons why histograms of height nevertheless often appear bimodal.

Abstract Molecular profiling, the classification of tissue or other specimens for diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive purposes based on multiple gene expression, is a technology that holds major promise for optimizing the management of patients with cancer. However, the use of these tests for clinical decision making presents many challenges to overcome. Assay development and data analysis in this field have been largely exploratory, and leave numerous possibilities for the introduction of bias. Standardization of profiles remains the exception. Classifier performance is usually overinterpreted by presenting the results as p-values or multiplicative effects (e.g., relative risks), while the absolute sensitivity and specificity of classification remain modest at best, especially when tested in large validation samples. Validation has often been done with suboptimal attention to methodology and protection from bias. The postulated classifier performance may be inflated compared to what these profiles can achieve. With the exception of breast cancer, we have little evidence about the incremental discrimination that molecular profiles can provide versus classic risk factors alone. Clinical trials have started to evaluate the utility of using molecular profiles for breast cancer management. Until we obtain data from these trials, the impact of these tests and the net benefit under real-life settings remain unknown. Optimal incorporation into clinical practice is not straightforward. Finally, cost-effectiveness is difficult to appreciate until these other challenges are addressed. Overall, molecular profiling is a fascinating and promising technology, but its incorporation into clinical decision making requires careful planning and robust evidence.

Abstract Ordered rating scales are one of the most frequently used question formats in large-scale surveys. Analysts of the responses to such questions often find themselves in need of describing the degree of agreement (concentration, consensus) of the answers to such questions. For that purpose they commonly use standard deviations of the response distributions, or measures based on these (such as the coefficient of consensus defined by Granberg and Holmberg, 1988), or the coefficient of variability, etc. This paper demonstrates that such measures are inappropriate for this purpose because they misrepresent what they are supposed to measure: the `peakedness&amp;rsquo; of a distribution. As an alternative a measure of agreement A is proposed. This measure is a weighted average of the degree of agreement that exists in the simple component parts – layers – into which any frequency distribution can be disaggregated, and for which agreement can be expressed in a straightforward and unequivocal way.

Abstract Gene networks are sets of genes functioning in a coordinated manner, their major components are the biopolymers DNA, RNA, and proteins. In this work, we consider a small network with several genes (they can be considered standalone) and observe the concentration of the corresponding proteins. Studying the dynamic behavior of gene networks is a complicated problem. Therefore, we research the principles of their functioning on special hypothetical model. These models can be describe by nonlinear system of differential equations. We are very interested in the questions on existence and stability of attractors in such models. Particular attention is paid to some multidimensional symmetric systems with negative and positive feedbacks. These systems are studied with a specially developed algorithm, which reduces them to a single equation with delayed argument. Cycles in this equation searched by Andronov-Hopf theorem and stability analyzes using the first Lyapunov coefficient. Computer modelling and numerical experiments with our models has been implemented in our special computer program called PhasePortraitAnalyzer. The mathematical core is developed in R, and the interface part is created using C# + WPF. Its software can build the graphical representation of the gene networks phase portraits, search equilibrium points, simulate the trajectory and perform other calculations for analyzing the target system. We can prove the correctness of the numerical solutions using some theorems on topology of the models.

Abstract For a model of a circadian oscillator presented in the form of a 6-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system, conditions of uniqueness of an equilibrium point and conditions of existence of a periodic trajectory (cycle) are established. A client-server application is developed to perform numerical experiments with this model on a cloud server and to visualize the results of these experiments.

Abstract To judge whether the difference between two point estimates is statistically significant, data analysts often examine the overlap between the two associated con dence intervals. We compare this technique to the standard method of testing signi cance under the common assumptions of consistency, asymptotic normality, and asymptoticindependenceof the estimates. Rejection of the null hypothesis by the method of examining overlap implies rejection by the standard method, whereas failure to reject by the method of examining overlap does not imply failure to reject by the standard method. As a consequence, the method of examining overlap is more conservative (i.e., rejects the null hypothesis less often) than the standard method when the null hypothesis is true, and it mistakenly fails to reject the null hypothesis more frequently than does the standard method when the null hypothesis is false. Although the method of examining overlap is simple and especially convenient when lists or graphs of confidence intervals have been presented, we conclude that it should not be used for formal significance testing unless the data analyst is aware of its deficiencies and unless the information needed to carry out a more appropriate procedure is unavailable.

Abstract Several reasons have contributed to the prolonged neglect into which the study of statistics, in its theoretical aspects, has fallen. In spite of the immense amount of fruitful labour which has been expended in its practical applications, the basic principles of this organ of science are still in a state of obscurity, and it cannot be denied that, during the recent rapid development of practical methods, fundamental problems have been ignored and fundamental paradoxes left unresolved. This anomalous state of statistical science is strikingly exemplified by a recent paper entitled &amp;ldquo;The Fundamental Problem of Practical Statistics,&amp;rdquo; in which one of the most eminent of modern statisticians presents what purports to be a general proof of BAYES&amp;rsquo; postulate, a proof which, in the opinion of a second statistician of equal eminence, &amp;ldquo;seems to rest upon a very peculiar &amp;ndash; not to say hardly supposable &amp;ndash; relation.&amp;rdquo;

Abstract Whether an extreme observation is an outlier or not, depends strongly on the corresponding tail behaviour of the underlying distribution. We develop an automatic, data-driven method to identify extreme tail behaviour that deviates from the intermediate and central characteristics. This allows for detecting extreme outliers or sets of extreme data that show less spread than the bulk of the data. To this end we extend a testing method proposed in Bhattacharya et al 2019 for the specific case of heavy tailed models, to all max-domains of attraction. Consequently we propose a tail-adjusted boxplot which yields a more accurate representation of possible outliers. Several examples and simulation results illustrate the finite sample behaviour of this approach.

Vol. 5. DOI: 10.3389/fams.2019.00043
Abstract The classic coefficient of variation (CV) is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and can be used to compare normally distributed data with respect to their variability, this measure has been widely used in many fields. In the Social Sciences, the CV is used to evaluate demographic heterogeneity and social aggregates such as race, sex, education and others. Data of this nature are usually not normally distributed, and the distributional characteristics can vary widely. In this sense, more accurate and robust estimator variations of the classic CV are needed to give a more realistic picture of the behavior of collected data. In this work, we empirically evaluate five measures of relative variability, including the classic CV, of finite sample sizes via Monte Carlo simulations. Our purpose is to give an insight into the behavior of these estimators, as their performance has not previously been systematically investigated. To represent different behaviors of the data, we considered some statistical distributions—which are frequently used to model data across various research fields. To enable comparisons, we consider parameters of these distributions that lead to a similar range of values for the CV. Our results indicate that CV estimators based on robust statistics of scale and location are more accurate and give the highest measure of efficiency. Finally, we study the stability of a robust CV estimator in psychological and genetic data and compare the results with the traditional CV.

Abstract Four experiments indicated that positive affect, induced by means of seeing a few minutes of a comedy film or by means of receiving a small bag of candy, improved performance on two tasks that are generally regarded as requiring creative ingenuity: Duncker&amp;rsquo;s (1945) candle task and M. T. Mednick, S. A. Mednick, and E. V. Mednick&amp;rsquo;s (1964) Remote Associates Test. One condition in which negative affect was induced and two in which subjects engaged in physical exercise (intended to represent atfectless arousal) failed to produce comparable improvements in creative performance. The influence of positive affect on creativity was discussed in terms of a broader theory of the impact of positive affect on cognitive organization.

Abstract The coefficient of variation (CV) is commonly used to measure relative dispersion. However, since it is based on the sample mean and standard deviation, outliers can adversely affect the CV. Additionally, for skewed distributions the mean and standard deviation do not have natural interpretations and, consequently, neither does the CV. Here we investigate the extent to which quantile-based measures of relative dispersion can provide appropriate summary information as an alternative to the CV. In particular, we investigate two measures, the first being the interquartile range (in lieu of the standard deviation), divided by the median (in lieu of the mean), and the second being the median absolute deviation (MAD), divided by the median, as robust estimators of relative dispersion. In addition to comparing the influence functions of the competing estimators and their asymptotic biases and variances, we compare interval estimators using simulation studies to assess coverage.

Abstract The effect size (ES) has been mainly introduced and investigated for changes in location under an assumption of Normality for the underlying population. However, there are many circumstances where populations are non-Normal, or depend on scale and shape and not just a location parameter. Our motivating application from e-commerce requires an ES which is appropriate for long-tailed distributions. We review some common ES measures. We then introduce two novel alternative ES for two-sample comparisons, one scale-free and one on the original scale of measurement, and analyse some theoretical properties. We examine these ES for two-sample comparison studies under an assumption of Normality and investigate what happens when both location and scale parameters differ. We explore ES for phenomena for non-Normal situations, using the Weibull family for illustration. Finally, for an application, we assess differences in customer behaviour when browsing E-commerce websites.

Abstract This article presents a selective survey of algorithms for the offline detection of multiple change points in multivariate time series. A general yet structuring methodological strategy is adopted to organize this vast body of work. More precisely, detection algorithms considered in this review are characterized by three elements: a cost function, a search method and a constraint on the number of changes. Each of those elements is described, reviewed and discussed separately. Implementations of the main algorithms described in this article are provided within a Python package called ruptures.

Abstract Examination of aggregate data on graduate admissions to the University of California, Berkeley, for fall 1973 shows a clear but misleading pattern of bias against female applicants. Examination of the disaggregated data reveals few decision-making units that show statistically significant departures from expected frequencies of female admissions, and about as many units appear to favor women as to favor men. If the data are properly pooled, taking into account the autonomy of departmental decision making, thus correcting for the tendency of women to apply to graduate departments that are more difficult for applicants of either sex to enter, there is a small but statistically significant bias in favor of women. The graduate departments that are easier to enter tend to be those that require more mathematics in the undergraduate preparatory curriculum. The bias in the aggregated data stems not from any pattern of discrimination on the part of admissions committees, which seem quite fair on the whole, but apparently from prior screening at earlier levels of the educational system. Women are shunted by their socialization and education toward fields of graduate study that are generally more crowded, less productive of completed degrees, and less well funded, and that frequently offer poorer professional employment prospects.

Abstract We briefly summarize some of the lessons learned in a workshop on cognitive studies of science and technology. Our purpose was to assemble a diverse group of practitioners to discuss the latest research, identify the stumbling blocks to advancement in this field, and brainstorm about directions for the future. Two questions became central themes. First, how can we combine artificial studies involving ‘spherical horses’ with fine-grained case studies of actual practice? Results obtained in the laboratory may have low applicability to real world situations. Second, how can we deal with academics’ attachments to their theoretical frameworks? Academics often like to develop unique ‘toothbrushes‘ and are reluctant to use anyone else’s. The workshop illustrated that toothbrushes can be shared and that spherical horses and fine-grained case studies can complement one another. Theories need to deal rigorously with the distributed character of scientific and technological problem solving. We hope this workshop will suggest directions more sophisticated theories might take.

Abstract The monograph investigates the misapplication of conventional statistical techniques to fat tailed distributions and looks for remedies, when possible. Switching from thin tailed to fat tailed distributions requires more than &amp;ldquo;changing the color of the dress&amp;rdquo;. Traditional asymptotics deal mainly with either n=1 or $n=\textbackslashinfty$, and the real world is in between, under of the &amp;ldquo;laws of the medium numbers&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;which vary widely across specific distributions. Both the law of large numbers and the generalized central limit mechanisms operate in highly idiosyncratic ways outside the standard Gaussian or Levy-Stable basins of convergence. A few examples: + The sample mean is rarely in line with the population mean, with effect on &amp;ldquo;naive empiricism&amp;rdquo;, but can be sometimes be estimated via parametric methods. + The &amp;ldquo;empirical distribution&amp;rdquo; is rarely empirical. + Parameter uncertainty has compounding effects on statistical metrics. + Dimension reduction (principal components) fails. + Inequality estimators (GINI or quantile contributions) are not additive and produce wrong results. + Many &amp;ldquo;biases&amp;rdquo; found in psychology become entirely rational under more sophisticated probability distributions + Most of the failures of financial economics, econometrics, and behavioral economics can be attributed to using the wrong distributions. This book, the first volume of the Technical Incerto, weaves a narrative around published journal articles.

Abstract Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz conducted a survey of civilian defensive gun use in 1992. In 1993, Kleck began publicizing the estimate that civilians use guns in self-defense against offenders up to 2.5 million times each year.&amp;rsquo; This figure has been widely used by the National Rifle Association and by gun advocates. It is also often cited in the media and even in Congress. The Kleck and Gertz (K-G) paper has now been published. It is clear, however, that its conclusions cannot be accepted as valid.

Abstract Gene networks are sets of genes functioning in a coordinated manner. Their major components are the biopolymers DNA, RNA, and proteins. In this paper, we consider a small network with several genes (they can be considered standalone) and observe the concentration of the corresponding proteins. Researching the dynamic behavior of gene networks is a complicated problem. Therefore, we research the principles of their functioning on special hypothetical model objects. These models can be described by a nonlinear differential system. Symmetry is a very important property of living systems. The phenomenon of symmetry can be observed in completely different biological models. The analysis of gene networks model symmetry allows us to construct special methods to solve such standard problems as the problem of existence and stability of attractors, to build the graphical representation of the gene network phase portraits, to determine equilibrium points, to simulate trajectory, etc. Also we performed computer modeling and conducted simulation experiments with our models in R language to verify obtained results.

Abstract The distinction between statistical significance and material significance in hypotheses testing is discussed. Modifications of the customary tests, in order to test for the absence of material significance, are derived for several parametric problems, for the chi-square test of goodness of fit, and for Student&amp;rsquo;s hypothesis. The latter permits one to test the hypothesis that the means of two normal populations of equal variance, do not differ by more than a stated amount.

Abstract In the practice of data analysis, there is a conceptual distinction between hypothesis testing, on the one hand, and estimation with quantified uncertainty on the other. Among frequentists in psychology, a shift of emphasis from hypothesis testing to estimation has been dubbed “the New Statistics” (Cumming 2014). A second conceptual distinction is between frequentist methods and Bayesian methods. Our main goal in this article is to explain how Bayesian methods achieve the goals of the New Statistics better than frequentist methods. The article reviews frequentist and Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing and to estimation with confidence or credible intervals. The article also describes Bayesian approaches to meta-analysis, randomized controlled trials, and power analysis.

Abstract The Busy Beaver function, with its incomprehensibly rapid growth, has captivated generations of computer scientists, mathematicians, and hobbyists. In this survey, I o er a personal view of the BB function 58 years after its introduction, emphasizing lesser-known insights, recent progress, and especially favorite open problems. Examples of such problems include: when does the BB function rst exceed the Ackermann function? Is the value of BB(20) independent of set theory? Can we prove that BB(n + 1) \textgreater 2BB(n) for large enough n? Given BB(n), how many advice bits are needed to compute BB(n + 1)? Do all Busy Beavers halt on all inputs, not just the 0 input? Is it decidable, given n, whether BB(n) is even or odd?

Abstract It is common to summarize statistical comparisons by declarations of statistical significance or nonsignificance. Here we discuss one problem with such declarations, namely that changes in statistical significance are often not themselves statistically significant. By this, we are not merely making the commonplace observation that any particular threshold is arbitrary—for example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from a 5.1% significance level to 4.9%, thus moving it into statistical significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even large changes in significance levels can correspond to small, nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities. The error we describe is conceptually different from other oftcited problems—that statistical significance is not the same as practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed differences in favor of the usually less interesting null hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance. Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that students and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between &amp;ldquo;significant&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;not significant&amp;rdquo; is not itself statistically significant.

Abstract Interval estimates – estimates of parameters that include an allowance for sampling uncertainty – have long been touted as a key component of statistical analyses. There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals (CIs): intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; CIs are thought to be a guide to which parameter values are plausible or reasonable; and the confidence coefficient of the interval (e.g., 95 %) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and can lead to unjustified or arbitrary inferences. For this reason, we caution against relying upon confidence interval theory to justify interval estimates, and suggest that other theories of interval estimation should be used instead.

Abstract The analysis of the empirical distribution of univariate data often includes the computation of location, scale, skewness, and tail-heaviness measures, which are estimates of specific parameters of the underlying population distribution. Several measures are available, but they differ by Gaussian efficiency, robustness regarding outliers, and meaning in the case of asymmetric distributions. In this article, we briefly compare, for each type of parameter (location, scale, skewness, and tail heaviness), the “classical” estimator based on (centered) moments of the empirical distribution, an estimator based on specific quantiles of the distribution, and an estimator based on pairwise comparisons of the observations. This last one always performs better than the other estimators, particularly in terms of robustness, but it requires a heavy computation time of an order of n

Abstract Moist savannas and tropical forests share the same climatic conditions and occur side by side. Experimental evidences show that the tree cover of these ecosystems exhibits a bimodal frequency distribution. This is considered as a proof of savanna–forest bistability, predicted by dynamic vegetation models based on non-linear differential equations. Here, we propose a change of perspective about the bimodality of tree cover distribution. We show, using a simple matrix model of tree dynamics, how the bimodality of tree cover can emerge from the switching between two linear dynamics of trees, one in presence and one in absence of fire, with a feedback between fire and trees. As consequence, we find that the transitions between moist savannas and tropical forests, if sharp, are not necessarily catastrophic.

Abstract Traditional quantile estimators that are based on one or two order statistics are a common way to estimate distribution quantiles based on the given samples. These estimators are robust, but their statistical efficiency is not always good enough. A more efficient alternative is the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator which uses a weighted sum of all order statistics. Whereas this approach provides more accurate estimations for the light-tailed distributions, it’s not robust. To be able to customize the tradeoff between statistical efficiency and robustness, we could consider a trimmed modification of the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator. In this approach, we discard order statistics with low weights according to the highest density interval of the beta distribution.

Abstract Many biases affect scientific research, causing a waste of resources, posing a threat to human health, and hampering scientific progress. These problems are hypothesized to be worsened by lack of consensus on theories and methods, by selective publication processes, and by career systems too heavily oriented toward productivity, such as those adopted in the United States (US). Here, we extracted 1,174 primary outcomes appearing in 82 meta-analyses published in health-related biological and behavioral research sampled from the Web of Science categories Genetics &amp;amp; Heredity and Psychiatry and measured how individual results deviated from the overall summary effect size within their respective meta-analysis. We found that primary studies whose outcome included behavioral parameters were generally more likely to report extreme effects, and those with a corresponding author based in the US were more likely to deviate in the direction predicted by their experimental hypotheses, particularly when their outcome did not include additional biological parameters. Nonbehavioral studies showed no such &amp;ldquo;US effect&amp;rdquo; and were subject mainly to sampling variance and small-study effects, which were stronger for non-US countries. Although this latter finding could be interpreted as a publication bias against non-US authors, the US effect observed in behavioral research is unlikely to be generated by editorial biases. Behavioral studies have lower methodological consensus and higher noise, making US researchers potentially more likely to express an underlying propensity to report strong and significant findings.

Abstract In this article, I discuss measures of effect size for two-group comparisons where data are not appropriately analyzed by least-squares methods. The Mann–Whitney test calculates a statistic that is a very useful measure of effect size, particularly suited to situations in which differences are measured on scales that either are ordinal or use arbitrary scale units. Both the difference in medians and the median difference between groups are also useful measures of effect size.

The statistical analysis was performed unsatisfactorily, but the effect size is decent and the results look believable. However, it is not clear to which extent the results can be generalized to other tasks and other populations (some of the possible concerns are discussed in the &amp;ldquo;Limitations&amp;rdquo; section on page 179).
Introduction There is a nice overview of the problem with a rich set of references.
Study 1 (Attention residue) The author introduces two research propositions:
RP1: People who do not finish Task A before switching to Task B experience more attention residue from Task A while working on Task B than do people who finish Task A prior to switching to Task B.
RP2: People who finish Task A under high time pressure exhibit less attention residue from Task A while working on Task B than do people who finish Task A under low time pressure.
Design:
84 undergraduate students (26 men; 58 women) random assignment to the (finished/unfinished) X (high/low time pressure) between-participants design The participants were told that they were going to participate in two separate studies crafted by different researchers. Procedure:
Task A (5 minutes; framing on intelligence): solving 17 clues in a fixed number of one-word answers (Appendix A) Three manipulation check questions (Table 1) If Task A is completed Satisfaction with own performance (7-point Likert scale) Consistency with the experimental conditions Lexical decision task (measures attention residue): quick distinguishing of real words from fake words (Table 2) Debriefing Task B (5 minutes): reviewing 4 CVs Manipulations:
Finished task: Task A is completed only if all 17 clues are solved in no more than 13 unique words Unfinished task: Task A is completed only if all 17 clues are solved in no more than 5 unique words (non-solvable) High time pressure: &amp;ldquo;Work as fast as you can&amp;rdquo;; background timer with announcement of remaining time every minute Low time pressure: &amp;ldquo;Work at your own pace&amp;rdquo; The study design feels good and is formed according to well-established recommendations by other research teams.</description></item><item><title>Why Most Discovered True Associations Are Inflated</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/ioannidis2008/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/ioannidis2008/</guid><description>Disclaimer The debate on whether research findings are credible is out of the scope. Assumption: considered research findings are true. First example is based on the previous work of the author: ioannidis2007a. While the original study van2002 is based on 117 patients (98 initial + 19 confirmatory), the author highlights only 19 patients from the second trial (to show the small sample size in the pioneer work).

Abstract Newly discovered true (non-null) associations often have inflated effects compared with the true effect sizes. I discuss here the main reasons for this inflation. First, theoretical considerations prove that when true discovery is claimed based on crossing a threshold of statistical significance and the discovery study is underpowered, the observed effects are expected to be inflated. This has been demonstrated in various fields ranging from early stopped clinical trials to genome-wide associations. Second, flexible analyses coupled with selective reporting may inflate the published discovered effects. The vibration ratio (the ratio of the largest vs. smallest effect on the same association approached with different analytic choices) can be very large. Third, effects may be inflated at the stage of interpretation due to diverse conflicts of interest. Discovered effects are not always inflated, and under some circumstances may be deflated-for example, in the setting of late discovery of associations in sequentially accumulated overpowered evidence, in some types of misclassification from measurement error, and in conflicts causing reverse biases. Finally, I discuss potential approaches to this problem. These include being cautious about newly discovered effect sizes, considering some rational down-adjustment, using analytical methods that correct for the anticipated inflation, ignoring the magnitude of the effect (if not necessary), conducting large studies in the discovery phase, using strict protocols for analyses, pursuing complete and transparent reporting of all results, placing emphasis on replication, and being fair with interpretation of results.</description></item><item><title>Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/ioannidis2005/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/ioannidis2005/</guid><description>Corollaries:
The smaller the studies conducted in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. The smaller the effect sizes in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. The greater the number and the lesser the selection of tested relationships in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. The greater the flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. The greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. How Can We Improve the Situation:
Better powered evidence. The totality of the evidence (including all false discoveries). Instead of chasing statistical significance, we should improve our understanding of the pre-study odds.

Abstract There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance.</description></item><item><title>Willingness to Share Research Data is Related to the Strength of the Evidence and the Quality of Reporting of Statistical Results</title><link>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/wicherts2011/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aakinshin.net/library/papers/wicherts2011/</guid><description>Reference Jelte M.
